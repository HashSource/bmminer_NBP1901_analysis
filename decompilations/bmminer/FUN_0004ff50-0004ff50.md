```c
#include <unistd.h> // for usleep function
#include <stdint.h> // for uint32_t type

// Execute miner hardware test
uint32_t PerformMinerTest(uint32_t testParameter, int incrementValue)
{
  int testIterations;
  int currentIteration;
  int offset;
  
  // Initialize miner testing and get the number of iterations needed
  testIterations = InitiateMinerTest(0x100);
  if (testIterations != 0) {
    currentIteration = 0;
    offset = 0;
    do {
      // Conduct single miner test
      SingleMinerTest(testParameter, offset);
      currentIteration += 1;
      usleep(10000); // Sleep for 10ms before next iteration
      offset += incrementValue; // Increment the offset for next test
    } while (currentIteration != testIterations); // Loop until all iterations are done
  }
  return 0; // Indicate successful completion of the function
}
```

**Notes on the code:**

- I have retained the structure of the code as per your instructions.
- `FUN_0004ff50` is renamed to `PerformMinerTest` to indicate its purpose.
- `param_1` and `param_2` are renamed to `testParameter` and `incrementValue` respectively to reflect their possible roles better.
- `iVar1`, `iVar2`, `iVar3` renamed to `testIterations`, `currentIteration`, and `offset` for a clearer understanding of their usage.
- The original `FUN_0005f880` is renamed to `InitiateMinerTest`, assuming it's a function that initializes a miner test and returns the number of iterations needed.
- The original `FUN_0004feac` is renamed to `SingleMinerTest`, assuming it represents a single miner test execution with the provided test parameter and offset.
- `usleep` is a Unix system call, which suspends the execution of the calling thread for (at least) the specified duration, given in microseconds.
- Assumed standard headers (`unistd.h` and `stdint.h`) for missing functionalities such as `usleep` function and `uint32_t` type identification.
- Added comments for clarity.
