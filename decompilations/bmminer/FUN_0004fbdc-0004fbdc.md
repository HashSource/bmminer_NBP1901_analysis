```c
// Function to initialize the Antminer hardware.
void initializeAntminerHardware(void)
{
  setupHardwareComponents();
  return;
}
```

Comments explaining the change:
- The function `FUN_0004fbdc` has been renamed to `initializeAntminerHardware` to clarify its purpose, assuming it initiates some hardware setup process based on typical patterns in embedded systems.
- The called function `FUN_0004fa10` has been renamed to `setupHardwareComponents` to suggest it is setting up various hardware components of the Antminer.
