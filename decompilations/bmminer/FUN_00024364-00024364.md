```c
void InitializeInterrupts(void)
{
  // Copies 256 bytes of data from the source (&DAT_00080da0) to the destination (&DAT_0007f8f8)
  memcpy(&InterruptVectorTable, &SourceData, 0x100);
  
  // Sets a function pointer at a specific location in the InterruptVectorTable to the InterruptHandler function
  InterruptVectorTable[0x104 / 4] = InterruptHandler;
  
  return;
}
```

Note: The `0x104 / 4` is used to calculate the correct offset within the `InterruptVectorTable` assuming it's an array of 32-bit values (`4` bytes per entry) and the entry is at offset `0x104`. Since the pseudo C code does not give the actual symbols' names for `DAT_0007f8f8, DAT_00080da0`, and `FUN_00023574`, I've renamed them to `InterruptVectorTable`, `SourceData`, and `InterruptHandler` respectively based on what would be typical in an embedded system â€“ but you should replace these with the actual names if known. The same goes for the size `0x100`, which is a placeholder for the actual size of the data being copied.
