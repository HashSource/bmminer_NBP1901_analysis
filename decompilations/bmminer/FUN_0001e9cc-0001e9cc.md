```c
void SetLedStateForAllChannels(undefined4 ledState)
{
  int initializeResult;
  uint channelIndex;
  
  channelIndex = 0;
  initializeResult = InitializeChannel(0);
  while (true) {
    if (initializeResult != 0) {
      SetLedState(channelIndex & 0xff, ledState);
    }
    channelIndex = channelIndex + 1;
    if (channelIndex == 4) break;  // Assuming there are 4 channels
    initializeResult = InitializeChannel(channelIndex);
  }
  return;
}
```

- The function `FUN_0001e9cc` has been renamed to `SetLedStateForAllChannels` to indicate its purpose.
- The parameter `param_1` has been renamed to `ledState` to suggest that it represents the LED state being passed in.
- The variable `iVar1` has been renamed to `initializeResult` to indicate it may represent the result of channel initialization.
- The variable `uVar2` has been renamed to `channelIndex` to indicate it is used as an iterator for channel indices.
- The function `FUN_0001e29c` has been renamed to `InitializeChannel`; it takes an index and is called before actions are taken on channels, implying initialization.
- The function `FUN_0004ffe8` has been renamed to `SetLedState` because it seems to manipulate the state of a specific channel based on the loop and condition surrounding it.
- Comments have been added for clarity, and the loop assumes there are 4 channels based on the check for when `channelIndex` equals 4.
- The bitwise AND operation `channelIndex & 0xff` is likely redundant since `channelIndex` is of type `uint` and already less than 0xff before the condition breaks the loop, but it has been left unchanged as per instructions.
