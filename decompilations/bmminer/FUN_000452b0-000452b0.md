```c
uint32_t GetMinerStatus(void)
{
  uint32_t minerStatus[3]; // Array space for miner status, though we only need the first element
  
  // Retrieve the miner status with a call to an unknown function, passing in '7' which could be a status code or identifier
  RetrieveMinerStatus(7, minerStatus);
  
  return minerStatus[0]; // Return the status stored in the first element of the array
}
```

Please, note that the original function named `FUN_00040314` is abstractly renamed as `RetrieveMinerStatus` to make the code more readable, assuming it retrieves the status of the miner based on the argument '7'. The array `local_c` is also renamed to `minerStatus` for clarity.
