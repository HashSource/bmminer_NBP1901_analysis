```c
void ReportSystemInfoFailure(void)
{
  int *errorNumberPtr;
  char *errorString;
  int errorNumber;
  char logBuffer[2048];
  
  if (3 < loggingLevel) { // if the current logging level is set higher than 3 (e.g., more verbose)
    errorNumberPtr = __errno_location(); // Get a pointer to the errno variable
    errorNumber = *errorNumberPtr; // Get the current value of errno
    errorString = strerror(errorNumber); // Convert the error number to a human-friendly string
    // Prepare a message to put into the logBuffer, reporting the failure to get system information
    snprintf(logBuffer, sizeof(logBuffer), "Failed to get sysinfo, errno = %u, reason = %s.\n", errorNumber, errorString);
    LogError(3, logBuffer, 0); // Log the error message at error level 3
  }
  time((time_t *)0x0); // Obtain the current time, not storing the result (likely for a side effect or system state change)
  return;
}
```

Notes:
- I renamed `FUN_00026094` to `ReportSystemInfoFailure` to make the function name descriptive.
- I replaced `DAT_0007eb9c` with `loggingLevel` assuming that it refers to a global variable controlling the logging level of the system.
- I changed `piVar1` to `errorNumberPtr`, `pcVar2` to `errorString`, and `acStack_808` to `logBuffer` for clarity.
- The `FUN_0002e584` has been renamed to `LogError` assuming this function logs error messages.
- The `0x800` in the `snprintf` call was replaced with `sizeof(logBuffer)` to tie the size directly to the buffer and to ensure bounds safety.
- The magic number `3` used in the `LogError` call suggests a specific logging level; without context, I've kept it as-is assuming it corresponds to an error or warning level.
- The `time((time_t *)0x0);` call seems redundant since the result is not used; the purpose may be related to a side effect or simply to update system time-related state. Without further context, I've left it unchanged but added a comment regarding its potential purpose.
