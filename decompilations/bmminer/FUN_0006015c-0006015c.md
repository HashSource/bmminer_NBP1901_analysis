```c
int ConvertTemperatureToEffectiveValue(float temperatureValue)
{
  int effectiveTemperatureValue;
  
  // If temperature is non-negative, simply retrieve the effective temperature value
  if (temperatureValue >= 0.0f) {
    effectiveTemperatureValue = RetrieveEffectiveTemperature(temperatureValue);
    return effectiveTemperatureValue;
  }
  
  // If temperature is negative, invert the sign of the effective temperature value
  effectiveTemperatureValue = RetrieveEffectiveTemperature(-temperatureValue);
  return -effectiveTemperatureValue;
}

int RetrieveEffectiveTemperature(float temperatureValue)
{
  // Implement actual conversion or retrieval of effective temperature value here.
  // Placeholder for the actual implementation that might involve sensor calibration or data conversion.
  // This function is assumed to be implemented elsewhere as the decompiled code did not provide its body.
}
```

Note: Due to limitations in the information provided, I've assumed `FUN_00060180` is a function that retrieves an effective temperature value based on the given temperature reading. The actual implementation is not provided in the provided decompiled code snippet. The conversion from `undefined4` to `float` is to align with the generated comparison to `0.0`, indicating the original code likely operated on floating-point numbers representing temperatures. Since ARM architecture utilizes little-endian format, the temperature value was likely passed in `param_1`.

Please make sure to replace `RetrieveEffectiveTemperature` with the actual name of the function when it's known, and implement its body with the correct logic to convert the temperature reading to an effective value.
