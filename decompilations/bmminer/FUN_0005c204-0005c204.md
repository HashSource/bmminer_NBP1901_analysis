```c
void ExtractFileNameFromPathAndCopy(undefined4 destinationBuffer, int sourceStructurePointer, undefined4 maxCopySize)
{
  char *lastSlashPosition;
  char *sourcePath;
  int sourcePathLength;
  
  sourcePathLength = *(int *)(sourceStructurePointer + 8);
  sourcePath = *(char **)(sourcePathLength + 0x110);  // Offset to the source path string within the structure
  lastSlashPosition = strrchr(sourcePath, '/');        // Find the last occurrence of '/' in the path
  sourcePathLength = *(int *)(sourcePathLength + 0x114);  // Offset to the length of path within the structure
  
  // If a slash was found in the path,
  // copy the substring that comes after the last slash, which is the file name, to the destination buffer.
  if (lastSlashPosition != (char *)0x0) {
    // +1 to move past the slash itself, and calculate the length of the filename by subtracting pointers
    CopyStringToBuffer(destinationBuffer, lastSlashPosition + 1, sourcePath + (sourcePathLength - (int)lastSlashPosition) - 1);
    return;
  }
  
  // If no slash was found (i.e. the path does not include a directory),
  // copy the entire path as it is considered to be a file name.
  CopyStringToBuffer(destinationBuffer, sourcePath, sourcePathLength);
  return;

Please note that the real function names and purposes of `FUN_0005f0d4` and the base structure referenced by `int sourceStructurePointer` are assumed based on context and need to be validated against the actual codebase for accuracy. `CopyStringToBuffer` is a placeholder for the actual function that handles string copying based on the three parameters provided.
