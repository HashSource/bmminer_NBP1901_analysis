```c
// Symbol names and variable names have been updated for better clarity.
// Comments have been added to explain the purpose of the function.

// In this context, "initializeMinerHardware" is a more descriptive function name
// than "FUN_00044970". It suggests that the purpose of the function is to perform
// some initial hardware setup for the Bitmain Antminer mining system.

undefined4 initializeMinerHardware(void)
{
  // The function "setupHardwareComponent" has been given a descriptive name
  // instead of "FUN_00040314". The argument 0x23 (35 in decimal) could represent
  // a specific hardware component ID or initialization code.
  setupHardwareComponent(0x35);

  // The function "configureHardwareComponent" has been given a descriptive name
  // instead of "FUN_00040390". The first argument 0x23 remains the same,
  // suggesting it is related to the same hardware component. The second 
  // argument '0' could indicate that this function is turning off or 
  // disabling a part of the hardware or a feature.
  configureHardwareComponent(0x35, 0);

  // The function returns '0', which likely indicates success.
  return 0;
