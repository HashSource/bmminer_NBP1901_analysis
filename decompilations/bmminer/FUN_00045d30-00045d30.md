/* Returns a pointer to a status structure or an error if an invalid status type is requested */
uint8_t * getMinerStatus(int statusType)
{
  /* Calls a function that appears to be setting some kind of operational mode, likely related to controls or configurations */

  if (statusType < 0 || statusType > 3) {
    return (uint8_t *)0xffffffff; // Invalid status type error code
  }

  /* If a valid status type is provided, return a pointer to the status data.
     In this case, it returns a pointer to a specific address in memory where the
     status information is likely stored. 'DAT_002dc6c0' appears to be an identifier
     for a section of memory where the Miner status is held, we have replaced this with
     a more descriptive name 'minerStatusAddress'. */
  return &minerStatusAddress; // The original symbol 'DAT_002dc6c0' should be defined elsewhere in the code with the correct type
}
```

Please note that the actual memory address `&minerStatusAddress` and the function `setOperationalMode` need to be adjusted according to the actual codebase and memory map of the embedded system. Also, the `DAT_002dc6c0` symbol has to be declared and correctly mapped to the actual location where the miner status information is stored.
