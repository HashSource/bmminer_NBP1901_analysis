```c
void DeleteZlogRecord(void *zlogRecordPtr)
{
  // Check if the pointer to the zlog record is not NULL
  if (zlogRecordPtr != NULL) {
    // Log a message with debug info stating that a zlog record is being deleted
    LogDebugMessage(0, "src/record.c", 22, "zlog_record_del[%p]", zlogRecordPtr);
    
    // Free the memory allocated to the zlog record
    free(zlogRecordPtr);
    return;
  }

  // If the pointer is NULL, log a warning message stating that the record pointer is NULL
  LogWarningMessage(2, "src/record.c", 21, "zlog_record_ptr is null or 0");
  return;
}
```

**Explanations**:
- Renamed `FUN_000582a0` to `DeleteZlogRecord` to describe its purpose.
- Renamed `param_1` to `zlogRecordPtr` for clarityâ€”indicating that it is a pointer to a zlog record.
- Changed the string in the logging functions to better indicate the file name (`record.c`) and line numbers to match with typical C conventions. These line numbers are placeholders and should be updated based on the actual line numbers in the source code.
- Renamed `FUN_0005df98` to `LogDebugMessage` and `LogWarningMessage` to clarify that these functions are used for logging messages, and updated the severity level in the name to reflect the type of message being logged. The actual severity level (`0` for debug, `2` for warning) is passed as the first argument.
- Added comments to describe the log messages and the conditions they are reporting.
