```c
int CalculateChipTemperature(uint rawTempValue, uint calibrationData)
{
  byte byteLowTempValue;
  byte byteHighTempValue;
  
  byteLowTempValue = (byte)rawTempValue; // Extract the low byte of the raw temperature value
  byteHighTempValue = (byte)(rawTempValue >> 8); // Extract the high byte of the raw temperature value
  
  // Compute the temperature using the calibration data and the extracted bytes from the raw temperature
  // The formula is a representation of the temperature calculation and may involve sensor-specific calibration
  return (int)(((25.0 / (float)(longlong)(int)(rawTempValue >> 0x10 & 0xff)) * // Divider from higher bits of rawTempValue
               (float)(longlong)(int)(calibrationData & 0xffff)) / // Multiplier from the lower 16-bits of calibrationData
              (float)(longlong) // Convert to float for the division operation
                     (int)((calibrationData >> 0x10 & 0xff) * // Extract multiplier from higher bits of calibrationData
                          (int)(short)(ushort)byteLowTempValue * (int)(short)(ushort)byteHighTempValue)); // Product of both byte values of the temperature
}
```

**Comments Explanation:**

- Renamed function to `CalculateChipTemperature` for clarity.
- Renamed parameters to `rawTempValue` and `calibrationData` to indicate their usage.
- Introduced `byteLowTempValue` and `byteHighTempValue` as more descriptive variable names for byte extraction from `rawTempValue`.
- Added inline comments to describe the purpose of each operation within the temperature calculation formula.
- The division and multiplication operations are based on both the raw temperature value and calibration data, likely specific to the sensor being used in the Bitmain Antminer.
