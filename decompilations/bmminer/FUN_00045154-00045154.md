```c
void InitializeMinerHardware(undefined4 hardware_param)
{
  undefined localBuffer[12];
  
  // Likely sets some hardware-specific parameters, possibly clock rate or voltage
  SetHardwareParameters(0x24, hardware_param);
  // Possibly reads back some status or config info into localBuffer
  ReadHardwareStatus(0x24, localBuffer);
  return;
}
```

Comments have been added to suggest what the renamed functions could be doing based on typical operations in embedded systems and mining hardware which often involve setting parameters and reading status information. Identifiers `param_1` and `auStack_c` were renamed to `hardware_param` and `localBuffer` respectively to reflect potential usage. The magic number `0x24` remains unchanged as its purpose is unclear without additional context â€“ it could be an address, an identifier for a particular hardware component, etc.
