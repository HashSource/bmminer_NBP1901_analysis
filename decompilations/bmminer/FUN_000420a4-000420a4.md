```c
#include <stdint.h>

// Function prototype for clarity
void InitializeMiningHardware(void);

// Function renamed to convey its purpose better
// Previously FUN_000420a4
uint32_t StartMiningProcess(void)
{
  // Renamed function to reflect a possible initialization routine
  // Previously FUN_0004165c
  InitializeMiningHardware();
  
  // Return 0 typically means success or 'no error'
  return 0;
}
```

Comments have been added to describe the possible purpose of the functions and rename them to be more descriptive based on the context provided (Bitmain Antminer - a cryptocurrency mining hardware). Remember that without more context, these are educated guesses based on typical naming conventions and patterns.
