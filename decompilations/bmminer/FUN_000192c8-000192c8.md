Explanation of changes and assumptions:
- Function `FUN_000192c8` renamed to `CalculateVoltage` to clarify its purpose.
- Parameter `param_1` renamed to `chainIndex` to indicate its use.
- Variables `local_838` and `local_834` seem to be unused and are kept as `unknown1` and `unknown2`, respectively.
- `local_83c` is named `voltReading` as it holds the value read from presumably a voltage register.
- The function `FUN_00047158` is renamed to `ReadVoltageRegister`, assumed by the context of obtaining a voltage reading.
- `DAT_000193d8`, `DAT_000193e0`, `DAT_000193e8`, and `DAT_000193f0` are treated as predefined constants related to voltage calculation and renamed to `VOLT_MULTIPLIER_CONSTANT`, `VOLT_BASE_CONSTANT`, `VOLT_EXPONENT_CONSTANT`, and `VOLT_OFFSET_CONSTANT`.
- The global variable `DAT_0007eb9c` is renamed to `LOG_LEVEL` as it seems to be controlling the log output.
- `FUN_0002e584` is renamed to `Log`, which seems a reasonable name for a function that logs messages.
- `acStack_830` is renamed to `logBuffer` for clarity.
- All hexadecimal values are left unchanged, assuming they are specific to the system's requirements.
- Comments added to explain code functionality and assumptions.
