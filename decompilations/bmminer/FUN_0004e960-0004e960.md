```c
void SetHardwareParameters(undefined4 hardwareSetting1, undefined4 hardwareSetting2, 
                           undefined4 hardwareSetting3, undefined4 hardwareSetting4)
{
  undefined4 localSetting2;
  undefined4 localSetting3;
  undefined4 localSetting4;
  
  localSetting2 = hardwareSetting2;
  localSetting3 = hardwareSetting3;
  localSetting4 = hardwareSetting4;
  
  // Apply settings to hardware; function name indicates it might initialize or configure hardware.
  InitializeHardware(hardwareSetting1, &localSetting2);
  
  return;
}
```

Note: The function `FUN_0004e8b0` has been renamed to `InitializeHardware` to indicate that it likely deals with initializing or configuring hardware with the provided settings. The parameters in the function `SetHardwareParameters` have been renamed to `hardwareSetting1` through `hardwareSetting4` to suggest that they are used to set up the hardware. The local variables within the stack (`uStack_c`, `uStack_8`, `uStack_4`) have been renamed to `localSetting2`, `localSetting3`, and `localSetting4`, reflecting that they are local copies of the settings, perhaps used in the subsequent initialization function. The original comments added by the decompiler (e.g., "undefined4") have been left in place, as they might be informative for someone working on this, but their relevance to the modified code is not clear without further context.
