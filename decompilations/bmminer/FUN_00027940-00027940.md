Note: The specific array sizes and struct offsets like `0x40`, `0x100000`, and `0xc` are from the original decompiled output and can have different meanings based on actual data layout which cannot be confirmed from the provided code snippet. I have provided variable names and function names that seem descriptive based on the context of the operations being performed, and replaced hardcoded error message assignments with `memcpy` for safety. Additionally, the function `LogErrorMessage` I have used is fictional and should represent the actual logging mechanism present in the real system.
