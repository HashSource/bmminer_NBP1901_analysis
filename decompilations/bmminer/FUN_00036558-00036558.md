```c
// SetGlobalParameter - Sets a global parameter to a given value
void SetGlobalParameter(undefined4 newValue)
{
  // The global variable named 'GlobalParam' possibly could represent a configuration setting or a state
  GlobalParam = newValue;

  // The function does not return any value and there's no further action taken after setting `GlobalParam`.
  return;
}
```

Comments:
- Renamed `FUN_00036558` to `SetGlobalParameter` to provide clarity on what the function might be doing.
- Renamed `param_1` to `newValue` to indicate that it is a new value passed to the function to update the global parameter.
- Added a comment for the global variable `DAT_004fcb30`, now named `GlobalParam`, to suggest that it might be a configuration setting or a state variable as the context is not provided.
- General comments were added to describe the function and its characteristics.
