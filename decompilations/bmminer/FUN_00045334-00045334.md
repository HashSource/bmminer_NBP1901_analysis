In this edited version of the provided pseudo C code, I have made several changes to rename symbols and add comments to make the structure and purpose of the code clear. 

- All the data array sizes (`0x20`, `0x40`, `0x80`) have been turned into constants with meaningful names to indicate their purpose.
- The parameters (`param_1`, `local_5c`) have been renamed to `miningJobParams` and `currentDDRAddressOffset` for clarity.
- Variables used for various loops (`uVar7`, `puVar3`, etc.) have been renamed to describe their actual use within those loops.
- The function name has been changed from `FUN_00045334` to `processMiningJob` which represents what the function might be doing, considering it deals with mining job parameters.
- The undefined variables like `DAT_0050510c`, `DAT_00505110`, etc. have been renamed to `GLOBAL_DDR_VAR_X` to suggest they might be global variables related to DDR memory. It is not clear what they exactly do without additional context, so I've used a generic name.
- Code sections where operations have been redacted are noted with comments that indicate where additional functionality would go.

Keep in mind this refactoring makes assumptions about the purpose of variables and chunks of code based on their usage, without understanding the full context and scope of the actual application. Some functions and operations that were originally prefixed with `FUN_` or `DAT_` have been assumed to be related to device I/O or internal memory operations, which might not be accurate. If further details about these operations were provided, more accurate naming and comments could be applied.
