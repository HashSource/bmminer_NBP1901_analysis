```c
void SetMinerVoltageAndFrequencyParameters(undefined4 *voltageAndFrequencyParams)
{
  undefined voltageRegValueBuffer[4];

  // Set voltage parameter to the miner via I2C or similar interface (0x25 could be the register address)
  I2CInterfaceWrite(0x25, voltageAndFrequencyParams[0]);

  // Set frequency parameter to the miner via I2C or similar interface (0x26 could be the register address)
  I2CInterfaceWrite(0x26, voltageAndFrequencyParams[1]);

  // Read back voltage setting from the miner for confirmation or logging
  I2CInterfaceRead(0x25, voltageRegValueBuffer);
  
  // Read back frequency setting from the miner for confirmation or logging
  I2CInterfaceRead(0x26, voltageRegValueBuffer);

  return;
}

// Note: The actual functions of the I2CInterfaceWrite and I2CInterfaceRead might differ based on
// the real implementation details which are not available from this decompiled pseudocode.
// The interface address 0x25 and 0x26, as well as their meaning as voltage and frequency respectively,
// are assumed based on context and could represent different functionalities or registers in the actual hardware.
