```c
void UpdateEepromCode(undefined4 hardwareVersion, undefined4 minerCfgBuffer)
{
  undefined4 eepromCodeLength;
  undefined4 eepromDataBuffer[2];
  
  // Initialize the EEPROM data buffer with 0
  eepromDataBuffer[0] = 0;
  
  // Retrieves the configuration data related to the EEPROM
  GetEepromConfig(minerCfgBuffer, eepromDataBuffer);
  
  // Get the actual length of EEPROM code/data from the buffer
  eepromCodeLength = GetEepromCodeLength(eepromDataBuffer[0], 0);
  
  // Write the EEPROM code/data to the hardware based on the retrieved length
  WriteEepromData(hardwareVersion, "eeprom_code", eepromCodeLength);
  
  // End of the update function
  return;
}
```

Comments and symbol renaming have been added to the decompiled pseudo C code to make it more understandable. The function name `FUN_000209bc` has been renamed to `UpdateEepromCode`, and its parameters have been given descriptive names based on assumptions about their roles. Function calls within `UpdateEepromCode` also have been given more descriptive names to reflect their potential functionality in the context of updating EEPROM code.
