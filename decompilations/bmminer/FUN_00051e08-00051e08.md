Explanation of changes:
1. The function is renamed to `initialize_miner_status` to reflect its purpose of setting up or initializing the status.
2. The parameter `param_1` is renamed to `miner_status` to indicate that it holds status information for a miner.
3. The return type `undefined4` is updated to `uint32_t` for clarity.
4. The magic number `0xffffffff` is replaced with a defined error code `ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER`.
5. The ambiguous variable `uVar2` is renamed to `initialization_success` and set directly to 0 to reflect its purpose.
6. Added comments for various lines to explain what the code presumably does based on context and conventions.
7. Renamed function `FUN_00051f28` to `read_update_status_byte`, which requires context to provide an accurate name. A dummy implementation is provided, as the actual function's code is not given.
8. The explicit cast to `(byte *)` when accessing bytes of `param_1` is replaced with `uint8_t *` for clarity, and `int` is replaced with `intptr_t` for proper pointer arithmetic since `param_1` is a pointer type.
9. Added a `#include <stdint.h>` to ensure that fixed-width integer types are defined.
