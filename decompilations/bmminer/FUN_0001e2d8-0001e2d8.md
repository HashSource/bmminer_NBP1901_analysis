```c
#include <stdint.h>

// Global variable for timestamp or another 8-byte data
uint64_t globalTimestamp = 0;

// Function to initialize the global timestamp or variable
uint32_t InitGlobalTimestamp(void)
{
  // Retrieve the 8-byte data passed in a register (often for arm64 ABI)
  // and store it in the global variable
  globalTimestamp = *((uint64_t*)&in_d0);
  
  // Return 0 indicating success
  return 0;
}
```

Note: Pseudo C code decompiled by Ghidra may not be perfect and variable 'in_d0' is assumed to be a register content passed to the function. Also, since it's pseudo-code, it lacks context about what 'in_d0' actually is, and how it is passed to the function. The original C code might have received an argument instead.
