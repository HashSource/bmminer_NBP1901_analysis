```c
void SetASICFrequency(undefined4 clockSetting, int chipIndex)
{
  // Sending a command to set the ASIC frequency
  // clockSetting: the desired frequency setting
  // chipIndex: the index of the ASIC chip to be configured
  // 1, 0, 0x90: additional fixed parameters for the command
  // ((chipIndex - 1U & 7) << 4 | 0x38001801): calculating the appropriate control value for the specified chip
  SendASICCommand(clockSetting, 1, 0, 0x144, ((chipIndex - 1U & 7) << 4) | 0x38001801);
  return;
