```c
void LogAndReportErrorCode(undefined4 logLevel)
{
  int errorCode;
  undefined4 errorValue;
  char logBuffer[2052];
  
  errorCode = DAT_0007f8f4; // Presumably a global error code
  if (4 < DAT_0007eb9c) { // Check if our current verbosity level allows us to log this message
    snprintf(logBuffer, 0x800, "error_code = %d\n", errorCode); // Prepare the log message
    FUN_0002e584(4, logBuffer, 0); // Log the error message, function might be `LogMessage` or similar
  }
  errorValue = FUN_0004e990(errorCode, errorCode >> 0x1f); // Process the error code, possibly to get a friendly description or a formatted value
  FUN_0004efd4(logLevel, "error_code", errorValue); // Report the error code, function might be `ReportError` or similar
  return;
}
```

Note: The pseudo C code has several `undefined4` types used, which are placeholders for 32-bit data types. They could represent integers, pointers, or other data types of that size. The actual data types depend on the context and usage which aren't clear from this snippet alone. The Global variables `DAT_0007f8f4` and `DAT_0007eb9c` are also kept unchanged as their purpose and type are not specified. The names of `FUN_0002e584` and `FUN_0004efd4` are placeholders and should be renamed when their actual purposes are understood. Similarly, `FUN_0004e990` seems to process the error code, but without more context, it's unclear what the intended name and functionality are.
