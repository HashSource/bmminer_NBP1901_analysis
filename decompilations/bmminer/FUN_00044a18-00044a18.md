```c
// Function: initializeAntminerHardware
// Description: This function initializes the hardware for the Bitmain Antminer.
// It is likely called early in the execution to prepare the system for operation.
// The values passed to `configureHardwareReg` and `setHardwareValue` suggest
// that it is setting up some registers or memory addresses specific to the miner's operations.
// Returns: The function returns '0', which usually indicates success in a UNIX environment.
unsigned int initializeAntminerHardware(void)
{
  // Function: configureHardwareReg
  // Description: This function likely configures a particular hardware register.
  // Since the parameter '0x23' is used, this could represent a specific register
  // address or an identifier for a configuration mode. This is a guess and needs
  // to be confirmed by looking at other code references or documentation.
  configureHardwareReg(0x23);

  // Function: setHardwareValue
  // Description: This function appears to set a value '0x2000' in a hardware-related 
  // memory address or register. The '0x23' could be the register address or identifier, 
  // and '0x2000' could be a bitmask or a data value being written to that location.
  setHardwareValue(0x23, 0x2000);

  // Return success (likely, as '0' is a common success return value in UNIX-like systems)
  return 0;
