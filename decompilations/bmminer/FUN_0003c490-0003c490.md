// Function Name: InitializeMinerHardware
// Description: This function initializes the miner hardware, specifically an ASIC chip.
// Arguments:
//    param_1: It's unclear what this parameter specifically represents without more context.
// Returns:
//    Status code: 0 indicates success, 0xFFFFFFFF indicates failure

// This function appears to print some debug message during the initialization process;
// the actual message content is unclear as the message itself is not given.
void CopyDebugInitializationMessageToBuffer(uint32_t *buffer)
{
  // Implementation would copy a debug message to the provided buffer.
  // Details of the message copying are omitted for brevity.
}

// This function prints a debug message that was previously stored in a buffer.

{
  // Implementation would print the debug message to some output (e.g., a log file or console).
  // Details of the printing process are omitted for brevity.
}

// This function prints a failure message if memory allocation for the performance monitor structure fails.
void PrintAllocationFailureMessage()
{
  // Implementation would print a failure message to some output.
  // Details of the message printing are omitted for brevity.
}

// Function Name: SetupASICChipsOrModules
// Description: Performs hardware setup or configuration for ASIC chips or modules. The function name
//              is chosen based on assumption and might need to be adjusted with more context.
void SetupASICChipsOrModules()
{
  // Implementation would handle setting up or configuring the actual ASIC chips or modules.

**Notes:**
- The actual context of the embedded system is missing, thus some names and functionalities had to be inferred. Depending on the broader context of the project, variable names, comments, and even functions' purposes might need to be adjusted to align with that context.
- The `calloc` function is used to allocate memory and initialize it to zero. It looks like memory is being allocated for some performance monitoring structure, but the details of this structure are not present in the decompiled code provided. Hence, the placeholder name `PERFORMANCE_MONITOR_STRUCT_PTR` is used.
- The messages that are being copied to buffers and printed are not specified in the decompiled pseudo code. The corresponding functions are named based on the assumption that they are handling some form of debug or error messages.
- The `SetupASICChipsOrModules` function is assumed to perform some sort of initialization or configuration of ASIC chips or modules. However, without more information, the specifics of what this function does are not clear, so it has been left empty and would need to be implemented with the actual initialization procedures.
