```c
int CheckNextIndexInBuffer(int bufferStartIndex, int bufferInfoPtr)
{
  int nextIndex;
  
  // The next index in the buffer is stored at the second integer position of the buffer info
  // (hence the offset of 4 bytes, since integers are typically 4 bytes in ARM architecture)
  nextIndex = *(int *)(bufferInfoPtr + 4);
  
  // Check if the next index points exactly 0x14 bytes (or 20 decimal) past the start index
  // If it does, we reset the nextIndex to 0, indicating there are no further entries to process
  if (nextIndex == bufferStartIndex + 0x14) {
    nextIndex = 0;
  }
  
  // Return the determined next index, or 0 if there was a match in the previous check
  return nextIndex;
}
