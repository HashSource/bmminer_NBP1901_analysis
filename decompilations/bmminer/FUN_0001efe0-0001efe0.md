```c
void sendCommandToAllAsics(uint32_t command, uint32_t arg1, uint32_t arg2, uint32_t arg3)
{
  int initStatus;
  uint32_t asicIndex;
  
  asicIndex = 0;
  initStatus = checkAsicInitializationStatus(0); // Check if the first ASIC is initialized
  while (true) {
    if (initStatus != 0) {
      sendCommandToAsic(asicIndex & 0xff, arg1, arg2, arg3); // Send command to the ASIC if initialized
    }
    asicIndex = asicIndex + 1;
    if (asicIndex == 4) break; // There are only 4 ASICs, stop after sending to all
    initStatus = checkAsicInitializationStatus(asicIndex); // Check the next ASIC's initialization status
  }
  return;
}
```

- Renamed `FUN_0001efe0` to `sendCommandToAllAsics` which reflects that it is sending a command to multiple ASICs.
- Changed `param_1` to `command` as it seems to be a command being sent to ASICs.
- Changed `param_2`, `param_3`, and `param_4` to `arg1`, `arg2`, and `arg3` respectively, which are probably arguments accompanying the command.
- Renamed `iVar1` to `initStatus` to clarify that this variable checks if an ASIC is initialized.
- Renamed `uVar2` to `asicIndex` as it is used to iterate over ASICs.
- Renamed `FUN_0001e29c` to `checkAsicInitializationStatus` to reflect the functionality that checks the initialization status of an ASIC.
- Renamed `FUN_00051694` to `sendCommandToAsic` indicating a function that sends a command to an individual ASIC.
- Added inline comments to help understand the flow and functionality of the code.
