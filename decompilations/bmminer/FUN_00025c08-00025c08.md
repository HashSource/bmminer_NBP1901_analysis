In the above code:

- Symbols starting with 'FUN_' and 'DAT_' were replaced with more meaningful names explaining their role.
- Magic numbers, such as '3' for a logging level or '4999' for a frequency check, have not been given symbolic names as there's no context to determine what they represent.
- Any commented text like "// Log the memory allocation failure" suggests where the code would log some event or error.
- The decompiled code had some issues like `-1` in `malloc` and potential misinterpretation of operations. It's common in decompiled code due to its attempt to reconstruct high-level constructs from a lower-level representation. Some of these were cleaned up where it was reasonably inferred what the original code intended to do.
- Comments in the modified code were added to describe the general purpose of each section and operation, assuming the function checks for "unbalanced" domains (possibly unhealthy or not performing as expected), it logs if necessary, and takes action based on the findings.
