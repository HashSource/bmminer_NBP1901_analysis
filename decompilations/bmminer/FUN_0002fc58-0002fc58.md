```c
void DestroyLinkedList(int **linkedListHead)
{
  int **currentNode;
  int **tempNode;
  int **nextNode;
  int *dataPointer;
  
  if (linkedListHead != NULL) { // Ensure the linked list head is not null
    nextNode = (int **)*linkedListHead; // Get the next node from the head
    currentNode = (int **)*linkedListHead[0]; // Get the first actual node
    while (nextNode != linkedListHead) { // Loop until we have traversed the entire list
      dataPointer = nextNode[1]; // Store the data pointer of the node to be deleted
      currentNode[1] = dataPointer; // Connect the previous node to the next node
      *dataPointer = (int)currentNode; // Update the back-link to the previous node
      free(nextNode - 1); // Free the memory of the node being deleted
      nextNode = (int **)*currentNode; // Move to the next node in the list
      currentNode = nextNode;
    }
    pthread_cond_destroy((pthread_cond_t *)(linkedListHead + 10)); // Destroy the linked list's condition variable
    pthread_mutex_destroy((pthread_mutex_t *)(linkedListHead + 3)); // Destroy the linked list's mutex
    free(linkedListHead); // Free the memory allocated for the linked list head
    return;
  }
  return;
}
```

I've renamed the function and variables to provide context that it's destroying a linked list and freeing its memory. Additionally, I've added comments to explain what each part of the function is doing. If the linked list has additional context or a specific structure that wasn't provided, you'll need to adjust the naming and comments to fit that context.
