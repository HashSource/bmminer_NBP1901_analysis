```c
void ProcessHardwareError(int hardwareContext)
{
  // Check if the error code at offset 0x3c is not equal to 0x100 (256 in decimal)
  if (*(int *)(hardwareContext + 0x3c) != 0x100) {
    // If not, handle a regular error by calling the appropriate function with a specific offset
    HandleRegularError(hardwareContext + 0x28);
    return;
  }
  // If the error code is 0x100, handle a critical error instead
  HandleCriticalError(*(undefined4 *)(hardwareContext + 0x40));
  
  // Reset the error-related fields in the context structure
  *(undefined4 *)(hardwareContext + 0x40) = 0; // Reset error detail field
  *(undefined4 *)(hardwareContext + 0x44) = 0; // Reset additional error info field
  
  // Regardless of the error type, proceed to handle the regular error scenario
  HandleRegularError(hardwareContext + 0x28);
  return;
}
```

Notes:
- The function `ProcessHardwareError` takes an argument `hardwareContext`, which appears to be a pointer to a structure that stores hardware information, including error codes.
- The structure appears to have fields at specific offsets that store error codes and details (0x3c, 0x40, 0x44).
- If the error code is different from 0x100, the function handles a regular error; otherwise, it handles a critical error and resets the relevant fields.
- The actual functionality of `HandleRegularError` and `HandleCriticalError` depends on the corresponding definitions in the original codebase; they are presumably responsible for error notification, logging, or recovery operations. The names have been guessed based on context and should be verified against their definitions for accuracy.
- The mysterious `undefined4` is likely indicating a 32-bit unsigned field in the original binary structure. Since we do not have the original data types from the decompiled code, we use this placeholder type.
