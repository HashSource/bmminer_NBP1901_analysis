Note: In this refactored pseudo-code, I have made the following assumptions for renaming and commenting:
- The function `FUN_00038c70` is assumed to be named `HandlePatternSweep` based on its functionality.
- The parameters `param_1` and `param_2` are renamed to `sweep_type` and `pattern_file_path` respectively to reflect their probable usage.
- The global variables `DAT_0007eb9c` and `DAT_004fcb3c` are renamed to `_debug_level` and `_global_pattern_control_block` respectively as they appear to reference a debug level and a global control block for patterns.
- The constants and structures are represented logically based on context, but since the decompiled code is partial and lacks full context, these may be speculative.
- The function calls `FUN_000356c4`, `FUN_0002e584`, `FUN_00038450`, and `FUN_00037574` are replaced with assumed meaningful names like `LogError`, `DebugLog`, `InitializePatternA`, and `InitializePatternB` respectively. Definitions for these functions would need to be provided elsewhere in the code.
- For lengthy debug message preparation that is repeated, I mentioned that the code is omitted but the context is retained.
- The pattern control block is assumed to be a structure with pointers to functions and possibly other data, based on the way the code interacts with it. The specific offsets and function prototypes are inferred based on the usage patterns within the pseudo-code, but without more context, these are educated guesses.

Keep in mind that without additional context or the full program, it is not possible to provide perfectly accurate renaming or fully correct comments on functionality.
