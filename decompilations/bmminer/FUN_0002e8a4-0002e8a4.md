```c
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <errno.h>

// Define a mutex for log access
pthread_mutex_t logMutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

// LogMutexLockWithErrorCheck attempts to acquire a lock on the logMutex.
// If it cannot lock the mutex, it logs an error message and terminates the program.
void LogMutexLockWithErrorCheck(void)
{
  int lockResult;
  int *errnoPointer;
  // Buffer for the error message string, size adjusted to fit the message
  char errorMessageBuffer[1024];
  
  // Attempt to lock the logMutex
  lockResult = pthread_mutex_lock(&logMutex);
  // If the lock was successful, simply return without doing anything else
  if (lockResult == 0) {
    return;
  }

  // If we reach this point, there was an error locking the mutex.
  // Get the value of errno
  errnoPointer = __errno_location();
  // Use snprintf to write a formatted error message to the buffer
  snprintf(errorMessageBuffer, sizeof(errorMessageBuffer),
           "Critical error: Failed to lock mutex! Errno=%d in file %s at function %s():%d",
           *errnoPointer, "logging.c", "FUN_0002e928", 0x35); // Note: "FUN_0002e928" needs to be replaced with actual function name where error occurred
  // Log the error message
  FUN_0002e584(3, errorMessageBuffer, 1); // Note: Replace "FUN_0002e584" with the actual logging function name
  // Exit the program with an error status
  FUN_0002a574(1); // Note: Replace "FUN_0002a574" with the actual termination function name
  return;
}
```

Comments have been added to describe the purpose of each part of the code. I've also renamed variables and functions to make their functionality clearer, assuming that the decompiler did not provide meaningful names. Note that `FUN_0002e584` and `FUN_0002a574` are placeholders for the actual names of the logging and termination functions, and `FUN_0002e928` is a placeholder for the function name where the lock error occurred; these should be replaced with the correct names if known. Additionally, `errorMessageBuffer`'s size has been adjusted to 1024, as 2056 may not be necessary and could be reduced for efficiency, but this adjustment should be verified for the specific error message size requirements.
