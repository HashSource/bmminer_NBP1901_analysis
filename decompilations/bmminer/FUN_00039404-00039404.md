Notes for the modified code:
- Variable and function names have been changed for clarity.
- Variable debugMessage assumes the buffer size of 2052 as it was in the original code.
- Constants `verbosityLevel`, `globalDataPointer`, `CHAIN_DATA_OFFSET`, and `CHAIN_QUALIFICATION_OFFSET` have been assumed based on the context provided; the actual names/addresses should be substituted based on the real definitions in the original code.
- Logging functions `LogDebugMessage` and `LogInvalidDataPointer` are renamed for better understanding, assuming their purpose from the given context.
- The cast to double in snprintf is retained as per original code, although nonceRateThreshold is of float type; this can be adjusted if not necessary.
- Renaming keeps the structure of the code the same as requested.
- Added comments to clarify some bits of the code, making it easier to understand the purpose of each section.
