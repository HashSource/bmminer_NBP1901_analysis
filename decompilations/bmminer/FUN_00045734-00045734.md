```c
void SetFrequencyForASIC(uint chip_frequency_selection)
{
  pthread_mutex_t *asicFrequencyMutex;
  uint frequencyParameters[2];
  
  asicFrequencyMutex = globalASICFrequencyMutex; // Assumes DAT_00045784 is a mutex for ASIC frequency
  pthread_mutex_lock(globalASICFrequencyMutex);
  usleep(50000); // Wait for 50 milliseconds
  
  // Read the current frequency settings into local frequencyParameters array
  ReadASICFrequencySettings(0x1b, frequencyParameters);
  
  // Mask and combine the frequency setting to only alter the relevant bits
  // and send the update to the ASIC by calling with the adjusted frequency
  UpdateASICFrequency(frequencyParameters[0] & 0xffffffc0 | chip_frequency_selection & 0x3f);
  
  // Unlock the mutex after the operation
  pthread_mutex_unlock(asicFrequencyMutex);
  
  return;
}
```

Explanation:

- The original function `FUN_00045734` has been renamed to `SetFrequencyForASIC` as it seems to be setting the frequency for an ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) used in the Antminer.
- The first argument, `uint param_1`, has been renamed to `chip_frequency_selection`, assuming this variable holds the new frequency setting for the ASIC.
- The local variable `local_14` has been renamed to `frequencyParameters`, assuming this array will hold frequency-related parameters read from the ASIC.
- Variables and function names starting with `DAT_` or `FUN_` are placeholder names often used by Ghidra when it doesn't have context for what the name should be. These have been renamed to more descriptive names like `globalASICFrequencyMutex`, `ReadASICFrequencySettings`, and `UpdateASICFrequency` based on their apparent purpose in the code.
- Added explanatory comments to clarify what each part of the function is doing.
