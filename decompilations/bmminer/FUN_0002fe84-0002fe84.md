```c
void ShutdownThreadAndSemaphore(int threadDataPtr)
{
  // Return immediately if the pointer is null
  if (threadDataPtr == 0) {
    return;
  }

  // Get the thread ID from the structure at the given pointer offset 0xC
  pthread_t threadId = *(pthread_t *)(threadDataPtr + 0xC);

  // Check if the thread ID is non-zero (assumes a zero thread ID is invalid or uninitialized)
  if (threadId == 0) {
    // If the thread ID is not valid, only destroy the semaphore at offset 0x10
    sem_destroy((sem_t *)(threadDataPtr + 0x10));
    return;
  }
  
  // Cancel the running thread using its thread ID
  pthread_cancel(threadId);

  // Zero out the memory where the thread ID was stored
  *(pthread_t *)(threadDataPtr + 0xC) = 0;

  // Destroy the semaphore associated with the thread at offset 0x10
  sem_destroy((sem_t *)(threadDataPtr + 0x10));
  
  // After cancelling the thread and destroying the semaphore, return from the function
  return;
}
```

I've renamed the function to `ShutdownThreadAndSemaphore` to better represent its behaviour, which is stopping a pthread and destroying an associated semaphore. Variables and structure members have been renamed for clarity, with offsets within the structure marked with comments. Comments have also been added throughout to describe what each section of the code is doing.
