```c
void UpdateMiningStatus(int statusUpdateFlag)
{
  // Declare variables to hold a floating point value but initialize them as integers.
  // This is commonly done when decompiling code, but may not represent the original source.
  // Local variable names have been chosen to suggest they could be part of a larger structure,
  // like a JSON object or a set of parameters to be sent.
  undefined4 floatHolder1;
  undefined4 floatHolder2;
  undefined4 floatHolder3;
  undefined4 floatHolder4;
  
  // a buffer to hold a log message or string to be outputted
  char logBuffer[2048];

  // Initialize float holders with zero - assumed to be placeholders for actual float values
  floatHolder1 = 0;
  floatHolder2 = 0;
  floatHolder3 = 0;
  floatHolder4 = 0;

  // If statusUpdateFlag is zero, we only want to log specific conditions.
  if (statusUpdateFlag == 0) {
    // These three globals seem to be status indicators for errors or specific states.
    // The purpose of these globals is inferred from their usage.
    if (globalErrorFlag != '\0' || globalSecondaryErrorFlag != '\0' || globalStatusCount > 2) {
      // Format a log message indicating a bad input parameter.
      snprintf(logBuffer, 0x800, "%s: input bad json param\n", globalLogPrefix);
      // Log the error using a logging function, which has been renamed for clarity.
      LogError(3, logBuffer, 0);
    }
    return; // Early return if no action is required.
  }

  // This function might reset state or perform some necessary pre-update operations.
  PrepareForStatusUpdate();

  // Format the potential floats as string with 2 decimal precision.
  snprintf((char *)&floatHolder1, 0x10, "%.2f");

  // It converts the formatted floatHolder1 values, assumed to be strings, to actual float values.
  undefined4 floatValue = ConvertStringToFloat(&floatHolder1);

  // This function updates the status with the float value corresponding to a 'rate_5s' key.
  // The key suggests that this is a status update for a "rate" over the past 5 seconds.
  UpdateStatusWithKey(statusUpdateFlag, "rate_5s", floatValue);

  return;
}
```

In the above code, the function originally named `FUN_0001f490` has been renamed to `UpdateMiningStatus`, suggesting the function is related to updating the status of a mining operation, potentially cryptocurrency mining, given the context of it being part of a Bitmain Antminer's firmware.

To improve clarity:
- Variables within the function were renamed for readability and to suggest their potential use.
- Comments were added to clarify the steps of the function and the intent behind specific lines of code.
- The names of other functions that this function calls have also been conjectured and renamed to suggest what their purpose might be, based on how they are used in this context.

Remember that renaming symbols and adding comments will not affect the functionality of the code; it only makes the code more readable and understandable to a human reader. The original behavior of the code remains the same.
