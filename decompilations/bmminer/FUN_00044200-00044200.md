Notes on the changes made to the original decompiled code:

- Renamed `FUN_00044200` to `writeEepromData` for clarity on the purpose of the function.
- Renamed `param_1`, `param_2`, `param_3`, and `param_4` to `chainId`, `startAddr`, `writeLen`, and `dataValue` respectively to better reflect their usage.
- Renamed `iVar1` to `status` and `iVar3` to `writeLen` to better indicate their purpose.
- Renamed `bVar2` and `local_821` to `dataToWrite` and `currentValue` respectively, for better clarity.
- Replaced `acStack_820` with `errorMessageBuffer`, making the role of this buffer explicit as it's used for error messages.
- Renamed `FUN_000440e8()` to `openEeprom()` assuming it's the EEPROM opening function based on the context.
- Renamed `FUN_00049794()` to `i2cWrite()`, assuming the EEPROM communication is done using the I2C protocol.
- Renamed `DAT_0050508c` and `DAT_00505088` to `EEPROM_STATUS_ARRAY` and `EEPROM_DEVICE_HANDLES` to suggest these might be arrays holding the status and handles for multiple EEPROM devices.
- Renamed `FUN_0002e584()` to `logError()`, suggesting it logs error messages.
- Simplified the check for write failure by using the exact value `writeResult != 1`.
- Replaced the original string literals with the function name "writeEepromData" when logging error messages, assuming the `DAT_00044354` was a placeholder for the function name.
- Added the hex values as comments for the returned error codes to indicate they are predefined error values.
- Added inline comments throughout the code to explain the logic and changes more clearly.

Keep in mind that the use of specific functions and data structure names (`openEeprom`, `i2cWrite`, `EEPROM_STATUS_ARRAY`, `EEPROM_DEVICE_HANDLES`, `logError`) is based on a best guess through context. In actuality, these names need to be verified against the actual functionality of the referenced memory locations and functions in the original binary.
