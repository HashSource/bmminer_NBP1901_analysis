Explanation of changes and added comments:

1. Renamed `FUN_000573d8` to `initializeEvent` as it seems to initialize an event handling structure.
2. Renamed `param_1` to `workerCount` for better understanding that this is perhaps the number of workers we want to initialize.
3. Changed variable `__ptr` to `eventStruct` to indicate that it represents the structure for the event system.
4. Changed `pvVar1` to `workerArray` to suggest that it might be an array used to track worker threads or similar entities.
5. Renamed `iVar2` to `returnCode` to reflect its use in storing return codes from functions, signaling success or failure.
6. Changed `sVar3` to `hostNameLength` to more clearly represent the length of the hostname.
7. Renamed `pVar4` to `currentThreadID` to indicate it's holding the thread ID of the current thread.
8. Changed `lVar5` to `processID` to represent the process ID read by syscall.
9. Renamed `piVar6` to `errorLocation` as it's used to retrieve and store the location of the last error number.
10. Renamed `FUN_0005df98` to `logError` as it seems to log errors based on the provided parameters.
11. Renamed `FUN_00057364` to `freeEventStruct` for clarity on its purpose.
12. The magic numbers `0x1a8`, `0x1cc`, `0x1f0`, `0x218`, and `0x21c` likely refer to specific offsets within the structure, but without more context, we cannot provide more meaningful names.
13. The format strings in `sprintf` calls are incomplete, indicating that the decompiler might not have been able to properly resolve these calls. Proper format specifiers (such as `%lu` for unsigned long) should be used.
14. The syscall number `0xe0` is Linux-specific and corresponds to `gettid` for getting the thread ID in newer kernels if the syscall is directly invoked.
15. Comments were added to each section of the code to describe the actions being performed.
