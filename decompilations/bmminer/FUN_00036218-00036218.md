```c
// Debug log level, assumed global variable representing the current log level.
extern uint _currentDebugLogLevel;

FILE * checkSweepCompletion(void)
{
  FILE *scanFreqDoneFile;
  char debugLogMsg[1024]; // Assuming that the local_xxx variables are used for a debug message of 1024 bytes.

  // Try to open the file that indicates if the frequency sweeping is done.
  scanFreqDoneFile = fopen64("/config/scanfreqdone", "r");

  // Check if the current debug level is greater than 4 (presumably verbose level),
  // then print the debug message.
  if (_currentDebugLogLevel > 4) {
    // Prepare a debug message "DEBUG: Check if sweep is already done..."
    snprintf(debugLogMsg, sizeof(debugLogMsg), 
             "DEBUG: Check if sweep is already done...\n");
    // Log the debug message to some logging function presumed to be FUN_0002e584.
    FUN_0002e584(4, debugLogMsg, 0);
  }

  // If the file was opened successfully, close it and return success flag, otherwise return null.
  if (scanFreqDoneFile != NULL) {
    fclose(scanFreqDoneFile);
    scanFreqDoneFile = (FILE *)0x1; // Indicate that the sweep check was successful.
  }
  return scanFreqDoneFile;
}

// NOTE: The name 'FUN_0002e584' is not changed as the decompiled code does not give 
// enough context to understand what it specifically does. It seems to be used for logging.
// The actual function should be renamed to something like 'logDebugMessage' if that
// is its purpose, after understanding its functionality from other parts of the codebase.
