```c
void enableHardwareWatchdogTimer(undefined4 watchdogTimerHandle)
{
  uint watchdogControlValue;
  
  // Read the current value of the watchdog timer control register
  readFromHardwareRegister(0, watchdogTimerHandle, 0, 0x34, &watchdogControlValue);
  
  // Set the first bit of the control register value to enable the watchdog timer
  watchdogControlValue = watchdogControlValue | 1;
  
  // Write the modified control value back to the watchdog timer control register
  writeToHardwareRegister(watchdogTimerHandle, 1, 0, 0x34, watchdogControlValue);
  
  return;
}
```

Comments were added to the code to explain the process of enabling the watchdog timer on an embedded system, and function and variable names were changed to make the purpose of the code clearer.
