```c
// ReturnStatusOfMiner function retrieves the status of the mining hardware.
// It reads a specific memory location where the status is stored.
unsigned char GetMinerStatus(void)
{
  // DAT_0007f814 is likely a memory-mapped register or a specific memory address
  // that holds the status of the miner or a structure with control/status registers for the miner.
  // The (+0x1c) offset possibly refers to the status register within that memory region.
  // The function returns the value (status code) stored in that register.
  
  // The original line of code was returning the value as 'undefined'
  // which is a decompiler-specific placeholder for unknown data types.
  // Here, it is interpreted as an unsigned char which is typically 1 byte,
  // suitable for storing the status code.
  unsigned char *statusRegister = (unsigned char *)(MinerControlRegsBaseAddr + 0x1c);
  
  // Return the status code.
  return *statusRegister;
}
