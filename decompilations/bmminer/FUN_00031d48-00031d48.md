```c
// Global variable holding some state or configuration which is likely
// set elsewhere in the code. Its actual purpose would be clearer with more context.
uint32_t gSharedState;

// Function that retrieves the current value of the shared state.
uint32_t GetSharedState(void)
{
  return gSharedState;
}
```
