```c
int WaitForMinerStartup(void)
{
  int status;
  int minerStatus[2];
  
  status = 600; // Total iterations for the loop (3000 ms / 5 ms delay per iteration)
  minerStatus[0] = 0;
  do {
    GetMinerStatus(0xc, minerStatus); // Function to retrieve the current status of the miner
    if ((minerStatus[0] & 0x80000000) != 0) { // Check if the most significant bit (MSB) is set indicating an error
      return (minerStatus[0] >> 31); // Return the negated MSB (equivalent to the error code)
    }
    usleep(5000); // 5 ms delay for next status check
    status--; // Decrement loop counter
  } while (status != 0); 
  
  return 0; // Status check loop completed successfully without errors
}
```

This modified code includes renamed variables and functions, added comments for clarity, and adjustments in formatting for better code readability. The changes aim to make the code self-explanatory, indicating that the function is designed to wait for a miner to start up and assess its status in repeated intervals.
