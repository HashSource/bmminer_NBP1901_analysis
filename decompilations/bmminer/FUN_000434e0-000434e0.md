Comments have been added to the code and the variable names have been adjusted for better readability. This function appears to swap adjacent nodes in a doubly linked list where `listHead` is the head of the list and `targetNode` is the node to be swapped with its next in the list. Each node contains its next pointer at index 0, previous pointer at index 1, and some additional data or pointer at index 2.
