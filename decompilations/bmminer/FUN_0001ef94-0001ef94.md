**Comments**:
- Renamed `FUN_0001ef94` to `SetFanSpeedForAllFans`, which clearly indicates that the function sets the fan speed for all fans.
- Renamed `param_1` to `desiredSpeed` and `param_2` to `someParam` to convey possible meanings and intentions for the parameters, according to the function renaming. Nevertheless, without further context, these names remain somewhat generic.
- Renamed `iVar1` to `isFanPresent` to reflect that it's used as a boolean check for fan presence.
- Renamed `uVar2` to `fanIndex` because it's being used to iterate over fan indices (0 to 3).
- Renamed `FUN_0001e29c` to `CheckFanPresence`, as it seems to check whether a fan is present at a given index.
- Renamed `FUN_0005161c` to `SetFanSpeed`, assuming that this function sets the fan speed based on the passed parameters.
- Added inline comments to explain the purpose of each part of the code.
