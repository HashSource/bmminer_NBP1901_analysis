```c
void displayMinerInfo(void)
{
  uint fpgaVersion;
  char outputBuffer[2052]; // Increased buffer size for message
  
  retrieveMinerID(&minerID, 0x20); // Assuming 0x20 is the size of the miner ID
  if (verboseLoggingLevel > 3) { // Check if verbose logging level is greater than 3
    snprintf(outputBuffer, 0x800, "miner ID : %s\n", &minerID); // Store miner ID in the output buffer
    logMessage(3, outputBuffer, 0); // Log the message (log level 3)
  }
  fpgaVersion = getFPGAVersion(); // Get the FPGA version
  if (verboseLoggingLevel > 3) { // Check again for verbose logging level
    snprintf(outputBuffer, 0x800, "FPGA Version = 0x%04X\n", fpgaVersion & 0xffff);
    logMessage(3, outputBuffer, 0); // Log the FPGA version message (log level 3)
  }
  // Store the FPGA version in a global/external string, format as IP-like version
  sprintf(&fpgaVersionString, "%d.%d.%d.%d",
          fpgaVersion & 0xff,      // Major version number
          (fpgaVersion >> 8) & 0xff, // Minor version number
          1,                        // Revision number
          3);                       // Build number
  return;
}
```

In this code, I've assumed that `FUN_00044b54` retrieves a miner ID and stores it in `&minerID`, renaming it to `retrieveMinerID` for clarity. I've also assumed that `FUN_00045c98` retrieves the FPGA version and renamed it to `getFPGAVersion`, and that `FUN_0002e584` is a general logging function, renamed to `logMessage`.

The `&DAT_0099ede0` and `&DAT_00080fdc` indicate potential global or static data, which I've renamed to `&minerID` and `&fpgaVersionString` to reflect their likely usage (the actual names would depend on the rest of the code base and could be further renamed to reflect their purpose more clearly).

The global variable `DAT_0007eb9c` has been renamed to `verboseLoggingLevel` based on the context, suggesting it controls the verboseness of the logs. The value "3" might represent a specific log level.

Comments have been added to explain each major step and clarify the purpose of operations like the bitmasking and shifting performed on `fpgaVersion`. The `sprintf` formatting makes it resemble an IP address, which may indicate the convention used for representing version numbers in this system.
