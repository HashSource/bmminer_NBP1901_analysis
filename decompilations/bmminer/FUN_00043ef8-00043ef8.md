Here, I've renamed the function name and variables to reflect their purpose as nodes within what appears to be a linked list structure. The function seems to be searching for the predecessor node to the `targetNodePtr` in the linked list starting at `currentNodePtr`. Comments have been added to explain the steps taken throughout the function.
