```c
void restartAntminer(undefined4 shutdownType)
{
  // Shutdown the Antminer
  initiateShutdown();
  
  // Delay for 100,000 microseconds (0.1 seconds) to ensure that shutdown is handled
  usleep(100000);
  
  // Perform the restart with the specified shutdown type
  performRestart(shutdownType);
  
  // End of function, the Antminer should restart
  return;
}
```

Please note that renaming functions and variables to match their purpose is based on assumptions, as the actual functionality cannot be derived without further context or code analysis.
