```c
void freeEventMemory(void *eventPointer)
{
  // Check if the event pointer is not null
  if (eventPointer != NULL) {
    // If the pointer to the event data is not null, free the event data memory
    void ** eventDataPointer = (void **)((int)eventPointer + 0x174);
    if (*eventDataPointer != NULL) {
      free(*eventDataPointer);
    }
    // Log event deletion with a formatted message including the event pointer address
    logEvent(0, "src/event.c", 0x32, "zlog_event_del[%p]", eventPointer);
    // Free the memory of the event structure
    free(eventPointer);
  } else {
    // If the event pointer is null, log that the event is null
    logEvent(2, "src/event.c", 0x30, "eventPointer is null or 0");
  }
}
```

This function is responsible for freeing memory allocated to an event structure. It first checks if the event pointer is non-null, then it checks if the event data (located at an offset from the event pointer) is non-null before freeing it. After freeing any associated data, it logs the event deletion and then frees the event structure itself. If the event pointer is null, it logs a different message indicating that the event pointer was null.
