Note: The original code doesn't provide the actual names of functions, variables, and constants. In the suggested code, they are renamed based on the context and the patterns used in the code for better understanding. Additional comments have been added to provide insight into each part. Since we don't have the original header files or the surrounding codebase, assumptions have been made. The names starting with "GLOBAL_" are assumed to be global variables, while those starting with "Check", "Get", or "Log" are assumed to be function calls based on their usage patterns.
