```c
// Sets or clears the second bit of a global status variable based on input parameter
void SetSecondBitGlobalStatus(uint input_status)
{
  // Mask the second bit (0x04) with 0xFB (11111011) to clear it,
  // then set it according to the input_status' least significant bit shifted into the second position.
  // Casting is required because 'globalStatusVar' is a larger datatype and we are only modifying one byte.
  globalStatusVar = (byte)globalStatusVar & 0xFB | (byte)((input_status & 0x01) << 2);
  return;
}
```
Explanation of the changes:

- Renamed `FUN_00020a38` to `SetSecondBitGlobalStatus` to make the function's purpose clear.
- Renamed `param_1` to `input_status` to reflect its use as an input to determine the state of the second bit.
- Renamed `DAT_0007f8f4` to `globalStatusVar` and `_0_1_` to imply the specific byte being accessed in a larger data structure (which wasn't provided in the decompiled code snippet).
- Added comments to explain the purpose of the function and each step within it.
