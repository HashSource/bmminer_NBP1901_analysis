```c
// RetrieveMinerStatusByte
// Function to retrieve a specific status byte value from a global data segment
// identified by the symbol DAT_0058e01d presumed to relate to the miner's status.
unsigned char GetMinerStatusByte(void)
{
  // Return the value of the status byte (presumably representing the state of the miner)
  return MinerStatusByte;
}
```

Note: Without seeing how the symbol `DAT_0058e01d` is used elsewhere in the binary or how it's initialized, I can only infer that it's a status byte. Hence, I have renamed it to `MinerStatusByte` based on your description of the code being from a Bitmain Antminer. If there are more context and code, variable names, and comments should be updated accordingly to reflect their purpose with greater accuracy.
