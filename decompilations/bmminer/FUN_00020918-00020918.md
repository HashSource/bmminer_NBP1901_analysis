```c
void SaveEEPROMDataToDisk(unsigned int fileDescriptor,unsigned int eepromSize)
{
  unsigned int actualSize;
  unsigned int sizeBuffer[1];
  
  sizeBuffer[0] = 0; // Initialize size buffer
  GetEEPROMSizeFirmware(eepromSize, sizeBuffer); // Fetch actual size from EEPROM
  actualSize = FetchActualSize(sizeBuffer[0], 0); // Adjust size data
  WriteEEPROMDataToFile(fileDescriptor, "eeprom_bin", actualSize); // Save to file
  return;
}
```

Explanation of replaced names and added comments:
- Renamed `FUN_00020918` to `SaveEEPROMDataToDisk` to better describe the function's purpose.
- Renamed `param_1` to `fileDescriptor` to clarify that it holds a file descriptor.
- Renamed `param_2` to `eepromSize` indicating that it likely represents the size of the EEPROM data.
- Renamed `uVar1` to `actualSize` as it seems to be used to store the actual size of the EEPROM data.
- Renamed `local_14` to `sizeBuffer` to reflect its use as a buffer for size-related operations.
- Renamed `FUN_000182fc` to `GetEEPROMSizeFirmware` assuming it fetches some size information specific to the firmware or hardware operation.
- Renamed `FUN_0004e990` to `FetchActualSize` suggesting it modifies or validates the size before use.
- Renamed `FUN_0004efd4` to `WriteEEPROMDataToFile` indicating that it writes the data to a file.
- Added comments throughout the code to explain each step within the function.
