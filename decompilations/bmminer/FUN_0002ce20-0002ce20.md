**Comments and Instructions:**

1. I have renamed the function to `PrintChainInfo` for better clarity of what it might be doing.
2. All local variables are renamed to provide context based on their usage in the function.
3. I assumed that the original function is meant to print information about each chip and the cores within it for a piece of mining hardware.
4. Function names within `PrintChainInfo` that are called have been renamed to be more descriptive based on the context in which they are used.
5. The parameter names have been changed to `logLevel` and `chainId` to be more descriptive.
6. In the loop, `chainId` appears to be reused for a different purpose than originally intended. This reassignment may be an artifact of the decompilation and not best practice in actual code.
7. For initial debug information outputting, a block of the global DEBUG buffer is used, which suggests probably logging structured data.
8. For the log output related to "D_BIG", `chainId >> 2` seems to be implying that the data is grouped or chunked in some way that isn't clear from the decompiled code alone.
9. It was not always clear what the existing code was doing, such as the manipulations of pointers and debug buffers; assumptions are made based on common patterns and functionality observed in the code.
10. Please note that variable `logResult` is used without being initialized; this may be because of missing parts of the decompiled code or a mistake in the decompilation. I retained it as it appears in the original.
11. Similarly, `extraout_r1_00` and `extraout_r1_01` are artifacts from the decompilation with undefined origin and usage.
12. I did not alter any of the binary operations as they might be crucial for functionality, especially since embedded systems often work closely with hardware registers which require specific bit manipulations.
13. The `break` statement in the while loop will exit the loop when all possible cores have been processed or when `logBufferIndex` exceeds the number of cores that can be processed. This indicates a possible counting or enumeration process.
14. The function `snprintf` is used for formatting log data before it is passed to `LogFormattedData`; buffer sizes are assumed based on the decompiled code (0x800), which may represent an 2048-byte buffer.
15. The debug level is checked multiple times to decide whether to log information or not; the `_DEBUG_LOG_LEVEL` global variable presumably controls the verbosity of the logging.
16. The function concludes after iterating over a fixed number (4) of chips.

Please replace function names like `LogFormattedData`, `GetNumberOfCores`, `GetNumberOfChips`, etc., with actual function names in your context for proper linkage. Adjust the variable names and comments accordingly as well based on the complete understanding of the code you have.
