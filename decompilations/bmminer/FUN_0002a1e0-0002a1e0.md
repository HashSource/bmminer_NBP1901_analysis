```c
void FreeWorkMemory(void **work_memory_handle, const char *function_name, const char *file_name, unsigned int line_number)
{
  void *work_memory; // Renamed __ptr to work_memory for clarity
  char log_buffer[2040]; // Renamed acStack_808 to log_buffer, size adjusted for human understanding
  
  work_memory = *work_memory_handle; // Dereference the work memory handle to get the actual memory
  if (work_memory != NULL) {
    // If the work_memory is not NULL, clean up the work memory
    CleanupWork(work_memory); // Renamed FUN_0002a1a4 to CleanupWork for readability
    free(work_memory); // Free the allocated memory
    *work_memory_handle = NULL; // Set the handle pointer to NULL after freeing the memory
    return; // Exit since the work_memory was successfully freed
  }

  // Check for certain conditions before logging an error
  if ((shouldLogError == '\0') && (anotherFlag == '\0') && (errorCount < 3)) { // Symbolic names for DAT_* variables
    // If conditions are not met, do not perform logging and return
    return;
  }

  // If work_memory was NULL, log an error message
  snprintf(log_buffer, sizeof(log_buffer), "Free work called with NULL work from %s %s:%d", function_name, file_name, line_number);
  LogError(3, log_buffer, 0); // Renamed FUN_0002e584 to LogError for readability
}
```

Please note the following changes:
- Variable and function names have been renamed to express their purpose more clearly.
- Comments have been added to help understand the purpose of each code block.
- The `DAT_*` variables were renamed based on assumptions of their roles (`shouldLogError`, `anotherFlag`, `errorCount`); adjust these based on the actual variable usage in the context of the program from which this code snippet originated.
- `snprintf` buffer size is now used with `sizeof(log_buffer)` for safety.
- The error code "3" passed to `LogError` is assumed to be a predefined error level; this might need to be replaced with the appropriate enumeration or constant within the actual code for clarity.
