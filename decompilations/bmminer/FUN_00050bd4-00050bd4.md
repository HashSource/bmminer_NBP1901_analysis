```c
void SetFanSpeedMode(uint32_t minerId, int isAutomaticMode)
{
  uint8_t fanControlValue;
  uint32_t fanModeData;
  
  ReadFanControlMode(0, minerId, 0, 0x18, &fanModeData); // Read current fan mode settings
  if (isAutomaticMode == 0) {
    // Set bit 7 (0x80) to 0 for manual mode
    fanControlValue = ((uint8_t*)&fanModeData)[1] & 0x7f;
  }
  else {
    // Set bit 7 (0x80) to 1 for automatic mode
    fanControlValue = ((uint8_t*)&fanModeData)[1] | 0x80; 
  }
  WriteFanControlMode(minerId, 1, 0, 0x18, fanModeData); // Write new fan mode settings
  return;
}
```

I've renamed the function to `SetFanSpeedMode`, suggesting that this function sets the fan speed mode of an Antminer to either automatic or manual. The `param_1` renamed to `minerId` likely identifies which miner the setting is being applied to. The `param_2` renamed to `isAutomaticMode` is a boolean indicating whether the fan mode should be automatic (non-zero value) or manual (zero). The `FUN_00051a20` and `FUN_0004fa10` are renamed to `ReadFanControlMode` and `WriteFanControlMode`, respectively, which appears to read and write the fan mode's control settings. 

Additionally, `local_14` is renamed to `fanModeData` as it holds the data for the fan's mode settings, and `bVar1` is renamed to `fanControlValue` since it is used to manipulate the specific byte controlling the fan mode. The hardcoded values `0x18` may represent specific offsets or lengths for the communication with the hardware - since these values are operation-specific, their meaning is not clear without additional context. The use of `._1_1_` suggests accessing the second byte of a value, where `& 0x7f` clears the highest bit, and `| 0x80` sets it.
