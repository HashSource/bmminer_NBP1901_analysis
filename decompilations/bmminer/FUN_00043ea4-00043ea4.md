```c
int * FindTailOfLinkedList(int startOfList, int *currentNode)
{
  int *previousNode;
  
  // Continue traversing the linked list until we reach the end
  do {
    previousNode = currentNode;        // Keep track of the previous node
    currentNode = (int *)*previousNode; // Move to the next node in the list
  } while (currentNode != (int *)(startOfList + 4)); // Check if we've reached the end of the list
  
  // Return the last node in the linked list (before the end)
  return previousNode;
}
```

Comments have been added next to the code lines to describe the purpose of the variables and the logic of the loop that traverses the linked list. The variable and function names were modified to be more descriptive of their roles within the code.
