```c
void ShutdownMiner(void)
{
  // Gracefully shut down the mining process
  GracefulShutdown(ShutdownCommand);
  return;
}
```
**Notes:**
- Renamed `FUN_00036208` to `ShutdownMiner` to reflect the purpose of shutting down the miner.
- Renamed `FUN_000195a8` to `GracefulShutdown` to indicate its functionality.
- Renamed `DAT_004fcb2c` to `ShutdownCommand` to describe the data being passed to `GracefulShutdown` function, assuming it's a command or flag that instructs the shutdown process. 

Without the full context of the rest of the code, some of these names are assumptions based on typical patterns in such systems.
