```c
void ConfigureASICFrequency(undefined4 asicId)
{
  uint frequencyConfig;

  // Read frequency configuration for specified ASIC
  ReadASICFrequencyConfig(0, asicId, 0, 0x90, &frequencyConfig);
  
  // Modify the frequency configuration as required
  frequencyConfig = (frequencyConfig & 0xfffff7ff) | 0x800008a;
  
  // Write the new frequency configuration back to the ASIC
  WriteASICFrequencyConfig(asicId, 1, 0, 0x90, frequencyConfig);
  
  return;
}
```

Comments have been added to the code to explain the purpose of each function and the steps within the `ConfigureASICFrequency` function. Variable and function names have been changed to better reflect their purpose.
