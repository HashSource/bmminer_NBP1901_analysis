Please note that the original decompiled code and the provided pseudo C code have inconsistencies. For instance, the original decompiled code did not provide any context or declarations for the symbols `DAT_0050502c`, `DAT_00505028`, or the function `FUN_0002e584`. In the context of an ARM binary for Bitmain Antminer embedded system, these are likely specific variables or functions requiring domain-specific knowledge to properly rename. 

Moreover, `open64` is not a standard libc function but could be a specific version used in this context. For the sake of clarity, I have replaced it with `open`, which is the standard libc function for opening files. The flags `0x802` also have been replaced with standard flags `O_RDWR | O_NONBLOCK` that are typically used in file operation in POSIX systems.

The `log_error` function is a placeholder for whatever actual logging function is being used in the original code, which would log errors encountered while attempting to open the device file. This would likely take some kind of error code or message along with perhaps the originating function and line number.

`global_device_file_descriptor` is an assumed global variable holding the file descriptor, as it was indicated by the name `DAT_0050502c`, which was not a self-explanatory symbol. 

Lastly, the error string "open_lcd_failed...." was truncated in the original code; I've filled in a placeholder that seems logical, but the original error message would be necessary for exact replacement.
