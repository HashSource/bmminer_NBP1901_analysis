```c
void RemoveArrayElement(int *arrayLength, int arrayBaseAddr, int elementIndex)
{
  // Move memory to remove the element at the specified index from the array.
  // memmove(destination, source, numBytes):
  // We calculate destination and source by adding the element's offset to the base address.
  // The element size is 4 bytes (assuming the array is of integers).
  // We calculate the number of bytes to move by subtracting the element index from the total array length
  // and then multiplying by the size of the element (which is 4 bytes for an integer).
  memmove((void *)(arrayBaseAddr + elementIndex * 4), 
          (void *)(arrayBaseAddr + elementIndex * 4 + 4), 
          (*arrayLength - elementIndex) * 4);
  
  // Decrement the length of the array as one element is removed.
  *arrayLength = *arrayLength - 1;

  // No return value as the function is supposed to modify the array in place.
}
