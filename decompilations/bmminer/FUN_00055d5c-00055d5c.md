```c
void deleteCategoryTableEntry(int categoryTablePtr)
{
  // Check if the categoryTablePtr is not null
  if (categoryTablePtr != 0) {
    // Call cleanup function to delete the category table entry
    cleanupCategoryEntry();
    
    // Log the deletion of category table entry with the pointer address
    // Note: The original decompiled code seems to pass 0 instead of specifying the log level.
    logMessage(INFO, "src/category_table.c", 0x24, "zlog_category_table_del[%p]", categoryTablePtr);
    return;
  }
  
  // If the categoryTablePtr is null, log an error message
  logMessage(ERROR, "src/category_table.c", 0x22, "categories is null or 0");
  return;
}
```

**Notes:**
1. `FUN_0005d890` has been renamed to `cleanupCategoryEntry()` which implies it performs a cleanup operation on a category entry. The actual cleanup logic is unknown.
2. `FUN_0005df98` has been renamed to `logMessage()` which is presumably used for logging messages.
3. I assigned symbolic name `INFO` to the log level `0` and `ERROR` to the log level `2` based on a common convention; these might need to be updated depending on the actual log level values used in the system.
4. I assumed that `0x24` and `0x22` are line numbers or error codes; since their original purpose isn't clear, they have been left unchanged.
5. All symbol names (e.g., parameters, function names) have been updated for clarity based on the context provided.
