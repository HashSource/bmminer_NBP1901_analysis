```c
uint checkAllMinerStatus(void)
{
  int minerIndex;
  uint minerStatus;
  int isMinerActive;
  uint combinedStatus;
  
  minerIndex = 0;          // Start with the first miner
  combinedStatus = 0;      // Initialize the combined status of all miners to 0
  do {
    isMinerActive = isMinerRunning(minerIndex);
    if (isMinerActive != 0) {
      minerStatus = getMinerStatus(minerIndex);       // Get the status of the active miner
      combinedStatus = combinedStatus | minerStatus;  // Combine the statuses using bitwise OR
    }
    minerIndex = minerIndex + 1;  // Move to the next miner
  } while (minerIndex != 4);      // Assumes there are 4 miners total
  return combinedStatus;          // Return the combined status of all miners
}
```

In this modified code, function names, variables, and symbols have been renamed to reflect their purpose in the context of checking the status of miners in a Bitmain Antminer. The loop checks each miner in turn to see if it is active and, if so, retrieves its status and combines it into a collective status report for all miners. The `combinedStatus` variable represents the aggregate status across all of the miners, which is accumulated using a bitwise OR operation. The assumption is that there are a total of 4 miners to check.
