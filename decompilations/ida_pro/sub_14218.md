```c
int powerOffRearFan()
{
  char logMessageBuffer[2056]; // larger buffer for log message

  if (globalLogLevel > 3) // If log level is higher than 3 (more verbose)
  {
    strcpy(logMessageBuffer, "Note: rear fan is power off!\n"); // Prepare log message
    logWithSeverity(3, logMessageBuffer, 0); // Log the message with severity 3
  }
  return powerOffFan(1); // Power off the rear fan (fan ID 1)
}
```

- `sub_14218` has been renamed to `notifyAndPowerOffRearFan`, suggesting its dual function of logging a notification and powering off the rear fan.
- `v1` has been renamed to `logMessageBuffer`, indicating that this buffer stores log messages.
- `sub_2E584` has been renamed to `logWithSeverity`, suggesting that this function logs a message with a specific severity level.
- `sub_3FFEC` has been renamed to `powerOffFan`, indicating its purpose to power off a fan by given fan ID.
- `globalLogLevel` remains as it is, assuming that this global variable is referenced elsewhere in the code with the same name and represents the current logging level.
