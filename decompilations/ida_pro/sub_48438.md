* `sub_48438` has been renamed to `writePicI2C`.
* `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4`, and `a5` have been renamed to `chainIndex`, `command`, `data`, `argument4`, and `argument5` respectively, representing a chain index on the miner, a command to send, some associated data, and two additional arguments whose purpose is not clear from the context.
* `v9` has been renamed to `operationStatus` to reflect that it stores the status of the operation being performed.
* The local buffer `s` has been renamed to `logBuffer` to clarify that it is used to store log messages.
* `dword_99EE48` has been renamed to `chainHandles`, assuming that it is a global array holding references or handles related to the chains.
* `sub_46CA0` has been renamed to `writeI2C` assuming it writes i2c commands based on the context of the function name.
* `sub_46024` has been renamed to `openPicForChain` assuming it is a function that prepares or opens the PIC (Peripheral Interface Controller) for a specific chain.
