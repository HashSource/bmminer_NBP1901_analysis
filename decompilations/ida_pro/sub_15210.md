Changes made:

- Renamed `sub_15210` to `calibrateTemperatureSensors` to represent its functionality.
- Renamed `sub_1E170` to `checkCalibrationStatus` suggesting that it checks whether calibration can be initiated.
- Renamed `v3` to `chainIndex` to indicate that it's looping through an index of chains.
- Renamed `stru_7F7C0` to `calibrationMutex` to make it clear it's a mutex for the calibration process.
- Changed `dword_7F7BC` to `calibrationCompletedFlag` to indicate its use as a flag for completion status.
- Renamed `sub_14F20` to `resetCalibrationProcedure` assuming it resets any previous calibration state.
- Renamed `sub_1E29C` to `isChainCalibrated` suggesting it checks if a chain has already been calibrated.
- Renamed `v4` to `logBuffer` as it's used to store formatted log strings.
- `configureTemperatureSensor` stays the same assuming it is correctly named as per its function.
- Renamed `logMessage` to `logEvent` consistent with logging functionality.
- Updated function parameters and variable names in comments for clarity.

I have assumed that each renaming provides a more descriptive representation of each function or variable while maintaining the original logic and structure.
