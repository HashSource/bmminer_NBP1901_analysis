Explanation of changes made:

- The function name `sub_492A4` was renamed to `ReadVoltageDacValue` which reflects the functionality of reading data from a DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) and storing the read value into a buffer.
- The input parameter names `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, were changed to `chipID`, `targetBuffer`, and `dataLength` respectively making it clear what they represent.
- Variables `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`, `v9`, `v10`, `v12`, `v13`, `v14`, `v15`, `v16`, `v17`, `s` were renamed to `logContext`, `readResult`, `sourcePtr`, `bufferIndex`, `bufferEnd`, `bufferByte`, `initialDacValue`, `dacMSB`, `dacLSB`, `extendedDacValue`, `readDacValue`, `voltageSettings`, and `debugMessage`.
- The renamed `global_logContext` and `global_spiDevice` likely represent global variables that maintain the logging context and the SPI device interface used for communication with the external hardware DAC.
- `sub_48ABC()` and `sub_48520()` were renamed to `TryToOpenPower()` and `SendAndReceiveData()`, representing likely functionality according to context clues from the surrounding code.
- `sub_2E584()` was renamed to `LogError()` because it appears to serve the purpose of logging error messages based on the implementation details.
- A couple of unknown global variables `dword_505180` and `dword_50517C` were renamed to `global_logContext` and `global_spiDevice`, based on educated guesses of their purpose, though without additional code or context this is speculative.
- Magic values, such as the error code `-2147482880`, were not changed as their meaning is not clear without further context.
- Comments have not been added as there's not enough information on specific implementation details or the wider context of how the function is used.

Please note that without additional context about the code or the broader application, these renamings are based on inferences from the code's structure and use of variables. Further refinements would be possible with more information.
