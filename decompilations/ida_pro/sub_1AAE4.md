Explanation of Changes:
- The function name `sub_1AAE4` was renamed to `SetChainFrequency` to better describe its purpose.
- Variable names prefixed with `a` were changed to more descriptive names related to their purpose.
- Variables named `v5`, `v7`, etc., while retaining their register hints (e.g., `s0`, `r7`), were given meaningful names based on their usage within the function.
- The `v5` and `v7` variables are suspected to be `endFrequency` and `stepFreqValue`, although the original relationship is a bit unclear due to the direct translation. Adjustments were made to reflect their roles in calculating frequency steps.
- The `float` variables were renamed to indicate that they hold frequency-related values and to clarify their purpose during frequency calculations.
- Array `s` was renamed to `logBuffer` to indicate its use for logging messages.
- The magic number `0x800u` was kept as it is likely a buffer size understood by the decompiled code's context.
- The global variable `globalLogLevel` was assumed to influence whether logging takes place. The names were preserved since this seems to be a global logging level.
- The function `sub_1F0E0` was renamed to `InitializeChain` assuming the function initializes a chain based on its parameters.
- The function `sub_502C0` was renamed to `PerformStep` assuming it performs a step of some kind.
- The function `sub_1F164` was renamed to `UpdateChainFrequency` assuming it updates frequency for a specified chain.
- The `usleep` function takes a `__useconds_t` pointer which was incorrectly provided as a local label address `&loc_186A0`. It has been renamed to `&DelayValue` to suggest that it should reference a valid duration. The actual delay logic might need further investigation.
- Global variables `dword_7F8C4` were accessed in two array-like places. Assuming these represent boundaries of allowed frequencies for a given chain, they have been renamed to `ChainFrequencyBoundaryLow` and `ChainFrequencyBoundaryHigh`.

Note: The decompiled code has some inconsistencies that suggest it needs a careful review against the original source. Variable casts, treatments of pointers and arrays, and mathematical operations involving pointers suggest there may have been errors in decompilation.
