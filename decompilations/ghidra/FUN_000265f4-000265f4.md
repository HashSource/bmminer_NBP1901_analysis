```c
void InitializeSensorReadings(void)
{
  // Read initial sensor value from the specific sensor
  int initialSensorValue = ReadSensorValue();

  // Set global temperature reading variables with the initial value from the sensor
  CurrentTemperatureReading = initialSensorValue;
  PreviousTemperatureReading = initialSensorValue;
  MaxTemperatureReading = initialSensorValue;
  MinTemperatureReading = initialSensorValue;
  
  return;
}
```

Explanation of changes made:

- Renamed `FUN_000265f4` to `InitializeSensorReadings`, as it appears to initialize sensor readings.
- Renamed `FUN_00026104` to `ReadSensorValue`, implying that it reads a value from a sensor.
- Renamed `DAT_0007fa3c`, `DAT_0007fa08`, `DAT_0007fa40`, `DAT_0007fa38` to `CurrentTemperatureReading`, `PreviousTemperatureReading`, `MaxTemperatureReading`, `MinTemperatureReading`, making it clear that these are temperature reading variables.
- Removed unnecessary comments related to addresses (e.g., `0x0007fa3c`) as they are not informative in the context of the pseudo C code.
- Added a placeholder variable name `initialSensorValue` for holding the initial sensor value.
- Added comments explaining the purpose of each line to enhance readability.
