```c
#include <pthread.h>

// Forward declaration of functions whose implementations are not shown
void initializeHardwareMonitor(int identifier);
void performHardwareShutdown();

// Global variable indicating a mutex, for which the original name is unknown
pthread_mutex_t globalMutex;

void shutdownMinerRoutine(void *errorMessage, void *errorDetails, int shutdownRequired)
{
  // If a shutdown is required
  if (shutdownRequired != 0) {
    // Attempt to lock the global mutex
    pthread_mutex_trylock(&globalMutex);
    // Initialize the hardware monitor with identifier 0x2a (42)
    initializeHardwareMonitor(0x2a);
    // Call a function pointed to by a function pointer (original name unknown)
    performHardwareShutdown();
  }
  // Some other hardware control routine; the original name and purpose are not provided
  hardwareControlRoutine();

  // Print an error message to standard out, with additional padding spaces
  printf("%s%s%s", errorMessage, errorDetails, "                    \n");

  // Initialize the hardware monitor with identifier 0x37 (55)
  initializeHardwareMonitor(0x37);
  // Call a function pointed to by a function pointer (original name unknown)
  performHardwareShutdown();

  // Exit the function
  return;
}
```

I've renamed the function and its parameters, and added comments for clarity. Without knowing the exact purpose of the functions and variables it calls and uses, I've made educated guesses on names based on the context provided in the original code snippet.
