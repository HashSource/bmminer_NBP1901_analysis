```c
// Function to retrieve the current system status value.
// It returns a 32-bit unsigned value reflecting the status.
// The value is stored at a specific memory address (0x0058dfdc).

uint32_t GetSystemStatus(void)
{
  return system_status_value;
}
```

Please note, as you requested the renaming of symbols and variables, I've renamed `FUN_0001e120` to `GetSystemStatus` and `DAT_0058dfdc` to `system_status_value`. Keep in mind that, in the actual decompiled code, `system_status_value` would have been a placeholder name substituted by the location where this value resides in memory. You'll need to adjust these variable names to more accurately represent the specific context of this binary's operation.
