```c
#define MINER_REGISTER_B0 0xb0 // Assuming 0xb0 is a specific register for the miner operation

// Set specific miner register bit
// param_1: The identifier for the miner
uint32_t SetMinerRegisterBit(uint32_t minerId) {
  uint32_t registerValue;

  // Read the current value of the register at address 0xb0
  ReadMinerRegister(0, minerId, 0, MINER_REGISTER_B0, &registerValue);
  
  // Set the bit at the 5th position (0x10 in hex is 00010000 in binary)
  registerValue |= 0x10;
  
  // Write the modified value back to the register
  WriteMinerRegister(minerId, 1, 0, MINER_REGISTER_B0, registerValue);
  
  // Wait for 30ms to ensure the register has time to update
  usleep(30000);
  
  return 0; // Return success
}
```

In this pseudocode, I've made the following changes:
- Renamed `FUN_000514a4` to `SetMinerRegisterBit` to reflect the function's purpose.
- Renamed `FUN_00051a20` to `ReadMinerRegister` assuming it reads a register value from the miner.
- Renamed `FUN_0004fa10` to `WriteMinerRegister` assuming it writes a register value to the miner.
- Added a definition for `MINER_REGISTER_B0` with a comment to explain that `0xb0` is a miner register address.
- Renamed `param_1` to `minerId`, which represents the identifier of the miner.
- Renamed `local_c` to `registerValue`, which represents the value read from or written to a register.
- Added comments to describe each step of the function, including the purpose of the sleep function to provide a delay after writing to the register.

This should make the code more understandable. To provide a more accurate renaming, more context about the miner operation and the specific registers would be required.
