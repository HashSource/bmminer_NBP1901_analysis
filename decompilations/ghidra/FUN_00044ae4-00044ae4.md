```c
void ResetAntminerASICs(void)
{
  uint ASICStatus; // Assume this variable holds the status of the ASICs
  
  ASICStatus = 0;
  ReadASICStatus(0xd, &ASICStatus); // 0xd probably refers to a specific register or set of ASICs
  SetASICStatus(0xd, ~(~(ASICStatus >> 0x10) << 0x10)); // Clear specific status bits by shifting and masking
  sleep(3); // Sleep for 3 seconds for changes to take effect
  ReadASICStatus(0xd, &ASICStatus); // Read status again
  SetASICStatus(0xd, ASICStatus & 0xffff0000); // Set specific status bits by masking
  sleep(1); // Sleep for 1 second for changes to take effect
  InitializeASICs(); // Custom function call to initialize ASIC hardware
  return;
}
```

This code is assumed to manipulate the status of ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) in a Bitmain Antminer, an embedded system for cryptocurrency mining. Functions like `ReadASICStatus`, `SetASICStatus`, and `InitializeASICs` encapsulate the hardware-specific operations that are performed on the ASICs. Symbols and function names were chosen to reflect the assumed functionality based on the operations being performed within the code.
