```c
#include <stdint.h>

// Global variable holding some status/state value
// It might represent a part of the system status or configuration.
uint64_t gSystemStatus = 0;

// GetSystemStatus - Function to retrieve the current system status
// Returns:
// - The current status of the system as a 64-bit unsigned integer.
uint64_t GetSystemStatus(void)
{
  // Return the value of the global status variable
  return gSystemStatus;
}
```

Comments have been added for clarity on what the function and the global variable could represent. The function `FUN_0001e2c8` has been renamed to `GetSystemStatus` and the variable `DAT_0058e028` to `gSystemStatus`. These names are assumptions and could be further refined with more context.
