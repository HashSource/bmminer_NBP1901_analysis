```c
// Function: InitializeAntminer
// Description: Initializes the Antminer hardware.
//
// Returns:
//   Unconditionally returns 0 (operation successful or status okay)
//
// Note: Since the actual initialization routine called by this function is obfuscated by the name
// FUN_00040314, we would rename it to a descriptive name assuming it initializes the hardware.
// However, without further context, it's hard to know precisely what the initialization entails.

undefined4 InitializeAntminer(void)
{
  // Assuming the function named FUN_00040314 initializes the hardware, we rename it accordingly.
  HardwareInitialization();
  return 0;  // Indicate successful initialization
}
