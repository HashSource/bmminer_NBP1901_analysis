Comments and variable names were given to reflect the functionality deduced from the decompiled code. Any details that are not clear from the code, like the structure of the hardware base structure, were left generic. The key changes are:

- Renaming functions like `FUN_0002e584` to `LogDebugMessage`, and others to more appropriate, meaningful names like `HandleError` and `FreeHardwareBaseStructure`. The exact naming may depend on other parts of the codebase or project conventions.
- `DAT_0007eb9c` was named `verboseLevel`, assuming this global variable holds the current verbosity level for logging purposes.
- `DAT_004fcb34` was named `hardwareBasePointerGlobal`, assuming this global pointer holds a reference to some hardware base structure used throughout the program.
- `s__DEBUG__HW_sweep_init__00067728`, `s__DEBUG__Allocate_memory_for_hw_s_00067740`, `s_Fail_to_allocate_memory_for_hw_s_00067768`, and similar strings are likely debug messages; hence, they were simplified to store them in char pointers for logging.
- Changed the function signature to return a `uint32_t`, as the original `undefined4` indicates a 4-byte value which would be an unsigned int (32-bit) in standard C, and replaced `undefined4` with `uint32_t` for consistency.
- Buffer `local_810` and its associated variables were combined into a single `debugBuffer` array, as the original pseudo-code suggests there were multiple buffers used for some form of debug message construction.
- The code parts checking the verbose level before logging were structured to show conditional debug message construction based on verbose level explicitly.
