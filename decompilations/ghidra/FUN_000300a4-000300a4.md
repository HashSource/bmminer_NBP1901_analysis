```c
// Function to convert microsecond timestamp to millisecond timestamp
void ConvertMicrosecondToMillisecondTimestamp(uint32_t *timestampBuffer)
{
  // Variables to hold the decomposed parts of a 64-bit timestamp
  uint32_t microsecondLow;    // Low 32 bits of the input microseconds timestamp
  uint32_t microsecondHigh;   // High 32 bits of the input microseconds timestamp
  int remainder;              // Remainder from division storing leftover microseconds
  
  // Decompose input 64-bit value into two parts and then perform division.
  // The input value is stored in a combination of two registers
  // (or memory locations) due to stack alignment (endianness considerations).
  // An lldiv_t structure, which can hold the quotient and remainder of the long division,
  // is used to call lldiv which performs 64-bit division returning quotient and remainder.
  lldiv((lldiv_t *)&microsecondLow, 1000, CONCAT44(microsecondHigh, microsecondLow));
  
  // The resulting quotient represents the milliseconds.
  *timestampBuffer = microsecondLow;
  
  // The remainder is multiplied with 1000 to give leftover microseconds as part of the resulting timestamp.
  timestampBuffer[1] = remainder * 1000;
  
  // Function does not return a value as the result is passed via the input buffer.
