```c
void SetFanSpeedRegulator(uint32_t fan_speed_value)
{
  byte fan_speed_register_value[4];
  
  // Read current value from the fan speed regulator register
  ReadRegister(0x27, fan_speed_register_value);
  
  // Write the new fan speed value to the fan speed regulator register
  WriteRegister(0x27, fan_speed_value);
  
  // Read back the value from the fan speed regulator register to confirm the write
  ReadRegister(0x27, fan_speed_register_value);
  
  return;
}
```

**Note**: In the original code, `undefined auStack_c [4]` is used to hold the data from a register, which is a 4-byte or 32-bit value. The functions `FUN_00040314` and `FUN_00040390` have been renamed to `ReadRegister` and `WriteRegister` respectively, which are assumed to be functions to interact with the hardware registers of the fan control subsystem within the Antminer device. The parameter `0x27` is likely the address or identifier of the fan speed control register. The `param_1` passed to `SetFanSpeedRegulator` is the new fan speed value to be written to the register. The `undefined` keyword prior to the `auStack_c` array has been replaced with `byte` to represent that it is a byte array meant for holding the register's data.
