```c
void disableASICBoostFeature(uint32_t minerID) {
  uint32_t ASIC_status;

  // Read ASIC status with some specific parameters
  readASICStatus(0, minerID, 0, 0xb0, &ASIC_status);
  
  // Clear the specific bits related to the ASIC Boost feature
  ASIC_status = ASIC_status & 0xdffbffbf;
  
  // Write back the modified status to disable the ASIC Boost feature
  updateASICStatus(minerID, 1, 0, 0xb0, ASIC_status);
  
  return;
}
```

Explanation of the changes:
- Renamed `FUN_000513fc` to `disableASICBoostFeature`.
- Renamed `param_1` to `minerID` to indicate that this parameter likely represents the ID of the miner whose ASIC's boost feature is being disabled.
- Renamed `local_c` to `ASIC_status` to suggest that this variable holds some form of status for the ASIC.
- Renamed `FUN_00051a20` to `readASICStatus`. This name is a guess based on the usage pattern and the passed parameters, indicating a read operation.
- Renamed `FUN_0004fa10` to `updateASICStatus`. The name implies that this function is used to write or update the status of the ASIC.
- Added comments to explain the purpose of each step in the function.
