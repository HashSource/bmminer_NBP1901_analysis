```c
void freeBufferAndLog(void **bufferPointer)
{
  // If the buffer actually points to something
  if (*bufferPointer != NULL) {
    // Free the memory that the buffer is pointing to
    free(*bufferPointer);
  }
  // Log the buffer deletion with its address
  logBufferDeletion(0, "src/buf.c", 0x52, "zlog_buf_del[%p]", bufferPointer);
  // Free the memory for the pointer itself
  free(bufferPointer);
}
