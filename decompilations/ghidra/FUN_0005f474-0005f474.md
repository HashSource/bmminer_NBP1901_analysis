```c
#include <stdlib.h> // Include standard library for free() function

// Function: DeleteLoggingLevel
// Description: Deletes a logging level object and frees its associated memory.
// Arguments:
//   - loggingLevelPtr: A pointer to the logging level object to be deleted.
void DeleteLoggingLevel(void *loggingLevelPtr)
{
  // Check if the logging level pointer is not null
  if (loggingLevelPtr != NULL) {
    // Log the deletion with a debug message containing the pointer address
    LogDebugMsg(0, "src/level.c", 0x22, "zlog_level_del[%p]", loggingLevelPtr);
    // Free the memory associated with the logging level object
    free(loggingLevelPtr);
    // Return immediately after the free operation
    return;
  }
  // If the pointer was null, log a warning message indicating a null pointer was received
  LogWarningMsg(2, "src/level.c", 0x21, "a_level is null or 0");
  // Return after logging the warning message
  return;
}

// Note: The original code called two functions, FUN_0005df98 and free. In this modification:
// LogDebugMsg and LogWarningMsg are hypothetical function names to represent logging
// It's assumed that the logging functions take similar arguments to the original ones
