Changes and comments:

- Function name `FUN_00032924` changed to `CheckASICStatusAndLogOnFailure`.
- Variable `uVar1` changed to `remainingAsicCount` to indicate count of ASICs left to check.
- Variable `iVar2` changed to `readResult` to indicate the result of reading ASIC status.
- Array name `acStack_810` changed to `logBuffer` to indicate its use for logging.
- Renamed all functions according to their perceived functionality.
- Added comments to explain what each part of the code is likely doing.
- Referenced `DAT_0007eb9c` as `GLOBAL_MIN_ASIC_COUNT` since it seems to be a global threshold value, the name is a guess based on context.
- Assumed the meaning of some parameters from function names, as actual functionality is not provided.
- The actual numerical argument `0x800` for `snprintf` has been kept as is. It represents the size of the buffer, which happens to be `0x800` or `2048` in decimal.
- Because the decompiled code doesn't provide macro definitions or constants, I've added some comments that explain the possible interpretations based on the context and standard practices.
