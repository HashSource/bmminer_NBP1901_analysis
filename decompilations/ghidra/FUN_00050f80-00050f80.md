```c
// Function to set the mining hardware operational mode
void SetMiningMode(undefined4 hardwareId, undefined4 mode)
{
  // Set hardware operational mode with given parameters
  ConfigureHardware(hardwareId, 1, 0, 0x9c, mode);
  return;
}
```

Note: The function `FUN_0004fa10` has been renamed to `ConfigureHardware` for clarity. The function likely configures the hardware with specific operational parameters such as mode, represented by `param_2`. The `undefined4` is a placeholder for a 32-bit variable, the type of which is not known from the decompiled code. The numeric literals and other parameters such as `1`, `0`, and `0x9c` are not well understood without further context or documentation.
