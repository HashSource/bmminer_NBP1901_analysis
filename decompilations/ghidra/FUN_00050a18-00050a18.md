```c
void setCoolingFanState(uint32_t fanControllerAddress, uint32_t fanRegister, int fanState)
{
  byte modifiedFanValue;
  uint32_t readFanRegisterValue;
  
  // Read fan register value
  readFanRegister(fanControllerAddress, fanRegister, 0x18, &readFanRegisterValue);
  if (fanState == 0) {
    // Turn off the cooling fan (clear bit 2)
    modifiedFanValue = (byte)readFanRegisterValue & 0xFB;
  }
  else {
    // Turn on the cooling fan (set bit 2)
    modifiedFanValue = (byte)readFanRegisterValue | 4;
  }
  // Combine the modified bit with the rest of the register value
  readFanRegisterValue = (readFanRegisterValue & 0xFFFFFF00) | modifiedFanValue;
  // Write updated value back to the fan register to set the fan on or off
  writeFanRegister(fanControllerAddress, 0, fanRegister, 0x18, readFanRegisterValue);
  return;

Explanation of changes made to the code:

- Renamed `FUN_00050a18` to `setCoolingFanState` to clearly indicate the purpose of the function.
- Changed the function parameter names `param_1`, `param_2`, and `param_3` to `fanControllerAddress`, `fanRegister`, and `fanState` respectively, to better reflect their intended use.
- Renamed `bVar1` to `modifiedFanValue` to convey the intent that this variable will store the value to be written to the fan register.
- Renamed `local_14` to `readFanRegisterValue` to indicate that this variable holds the value read from the fan register.
- Replaced `FUN_00051a20` with `readFanRegister` to suggest the operation being carried out, though the original function name after decompilation is unknown.
- Replaced `FUN_0004fa10` with `writeFanRegister` to suggest the operation being carried out, though the original function name after decompilation is unknown.
- Added comments throughout the code to explain each step in the process of setting the state of the cooling fan.
- Adjusted the assignment of `local_14` to merge the modified byte with the rest of the register value while preserving the upper three bytes, enhancing readability and correctness.
