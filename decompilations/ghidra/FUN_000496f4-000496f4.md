```c
#include <pthread.h>

// Simulated extern data section
extern pthread_mutex_t i2c_mutex;

// Simulated data messages (You would replace these with the actual message string/definitions)
extern char failed_to_lock_i2c_msg[];

// Prototype for an unspecified function doing some operation, needing more context to rename
undefined4 PerformI2COperation(undefined4 param_1, undefined4 param_2, undefined4 param_3, undefined4 param_4, undefined4 param_5);

// Function to safely perform an I2C operation with mutex lock
undefined4 SafePerformI2COperation(
  undefined4 param_1,
  undefined4 param_2,
  undefined4 param_3,
  undefined4 param_4,
  undefined4 param_5
) {
  int lockResult;
  undefined4 operationResult;
  
  // Attempt to lock the mutex for I2C operations
  lockResult = pthread_mutex_lock(&i2c_mutex);
  
  if (lockResult == 0) { // Lock was successful
    // Perform the actual I2C operation
    operationResult = PerformI2COperation(param_1, param_2, param_3, param_4, param_5);
    
    // Unlock the mutex after the operation is done
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&i2c_mutex);
  } else {
    // If lock failed, set the result to a failure code
    operationResult = 0xfffffffc;
    
    // Prepare a message for logging the error
    char errorMessage[20];
    for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
      errorMessage[i] = failed_to_lock_i2c_msg[i]; // Copy error message from predefined location
    }

    // Function to handle error logging, assuming the function logs the message and is named accordingly
    // This function was not provided in the decompiled code, but you would replace it with the correct one
    LogErrorMessage(errorMessage);
  }
  
  return operationResult;
}
```

I've added comments, renamed variables and functions to be more descriptive, and simulated parts of the code that would interact with the rest of the system (like the error message and logging function). The structure and logic of the provided code have been preserved.
