```c
// Global data symbol presumed to be the base address of a status array
#define STATUS_ARRAY_BASE_ADDRESS  (*((uint8_t *)0x0058e018))

// RetrieveMinerStatus: Fetches the status byte for a specified miner.
// param_1: Index of the miner to retrieve the status for.
// Returns an undefined status byte from the status array.
uint8_t RetrieveMinerStatus(int minerIndex) {
  
  // Each miner's status is stored at an offset of minerIndex * 0x210 from the base address.
  // This returns the status byte for the miner at the given index.
  return STATUS_ARRAY_BASE_ADDRESS[minerIndex * 0x210];
}
```

**Note:** The original code you provided did not include type definitions for `undefined` and `DAT_0058e018`. I've interpreted `undefined` to represent an 8-bit value (which typically in C is `uint8_t`). The `DAT_0058e018` seems to be some form of global data and I've assumed it is representing a pointer to a location in memory which is usually represented with an address, so I've treated it as a pointer to an unsigned 8-bit integer. For the actual implementation, the correct types will need to be used depending on the rest of the codebase and the specific architecture details of the "Bitmain Antminer"'s embedded system.
