```c
// Improves the readability of the function and its parameters.
// The function seems to initiate a hardware-related operation, likely associated with mining activities.

  // Call another function with a specific set of parameters to perform an operation.
  // The magic number 0x80 could be a mode or a flag, and '0' a placeholder for future use.

  // The function does not return any value indicating it may be initializing or configuring hardware.
