    }
    
    // Calculate the address of the current device identifier in the list
    int32_t currentDeviceAddrOffset = deviceIndex * sizeof(int32_t);

    deviceIndex++;
    
    // Read device identifier from the device list and compare with the given identifier
    // Note: The list is assumed to be an array of integers, where each integer represents a device identifier
  } while ((*(int32_t *)(DEVICE_LIST_BASE_ADDR + currentDeviceAddrOffset) != deviceIdentifier) ||
           // Check if the current device is active
           (isDeviceActive = CheckDeviceStatus(deviceIndex - 1), isDeviceActive == 0));

}
```

Note: Since the actual implementation of `GetTotalDevices()` and `CheckDeviceStatus()` is not provided, they are treated as external functions. Moreover, without full context from the original binary, some assumptions had to be made (such as the nature of the device list and the meaning of "active"). The function now includes better naming for clarity, assume that `DEVICE_LIST_BASE_ADDR` is the starting address where devices are listed in memory, and each entry is 4 bytes (size of `int32_t`) since we're multiplying the index by `sizeof(int32_t)` to get the address offset.
