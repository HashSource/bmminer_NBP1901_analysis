```c
// Function to calculate time difference in milliseconds
// param_1: Pointer to an array representing the start time (two integers)
// param_2: Pointer to an array representing the end time (two integer)
// Note: Each array has two integers, the first is the number of seconds, and the second is the number of microseconds

undefined * CalculateTimeDiffInMilliseconds(int *startTime, int *endTime)
{
  // Check if the difference in seconds is less than the threshold (3601 seconds)
  if (*startTime - *endTime < 0xe11) {
    // Calculate the time difference in milliseconds
    return (undefined *)((*startTime - *endTime) * 1000 + (startTime[1] - endTime[1]) / 1000);
  }
  // If the difference is too large, return a pointer to a predefined error value
  return &DAT_0036ee80; // This seems to be a placeholder for an error value, but the actual value/address is not provided in this snippet
}
```
Note: Without the actual value of `&DAT_0036ee80`, the nature of the error cannot be deduced from this snippet alone. If `DAT_0036ee80` is a global variable or a static variable within the file, please provide its definition for a more accurate comment.
