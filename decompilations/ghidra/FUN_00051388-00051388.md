```c
void DisableASICBoostFeature(uint32_t chipAddress, uint32_t chainIndex)
{
  uint32_t configRegisterValue;
  
  // Read configuration register value with a specific command (0xB0) for the given chip and chain
  ReadASICRegister(1, chipAddress, chainIndex, COMMAND_READ_CONFIG, &configRegisterValue);
  
  // Clear the specific bits (bit 6, 14, 24, 26) related to ASICBoost feature in the register value
  configRegisterValue &= ~((1 << 6) | (1 << 14) | (1 << 24) | (1 << 26));
  
  // Write the modified configuration register value back to the ASIC to disable ASICBoost
  WriteASICRegister(chipAddress, chainIndex, 0, COMMAND_WRITE_CONFIG, configRegisterValue);
  
  // End of function, ASICBoost feature is now disabled for the specified chip
}
```

Note: In addition to renaming the variables and functions, I have assumed that the value `0xb0` represents a command used to read/write from a configuration register, hence I have named them `COMMAND_READ_CONFIG` and `COMMAND_WRITE_CONFIG`. These would typically be defined as constants somewhere else in the code. Also, I commented the bitwise operation to indicate which exact bits are being cleared to disable the ASICBoost feature.
