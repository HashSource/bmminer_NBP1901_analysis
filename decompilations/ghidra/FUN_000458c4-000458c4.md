```c
// This function retrieves and returns the value of a specific system parameter.
// It seems to be a part of a larger application, possibly related to the Bitmain Antminer's system configuration or monitoring.

uint32_t GetSystemParameter(void)
{
  uint32_t parameterValue[3]; // Define an array to store the parameter values, assuming we only care about the first value
  
  // Call a function that seems to retrieve system parameters. 
  // The '0x12' could be an ID or a code that specifies which parameter to retrieve, and 'parameterValue' is where the values are stored.
  RetrieveSystemParameters(0x18, parameterValue);
  
  // Return only the first value from 'parameterValue'. The rest of the array is not used in this context.
  return parameterValue[0];
}
```

Note: I've renamed `FUN_00040314` to `RetrieveSystemParameters`, and `FUN_000458c4` to `GetSystemParameter`. The magic number `0x12` has been left as-is because its significance would require more context to decode properly. The original array name `local_c` has been renamed to `parameterValue` to reflect its usage better. Comments are added for clarity.
