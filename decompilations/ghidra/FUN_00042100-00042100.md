```c
void InitializeHardwareComponent(void)
{
  int hardwareStatus;
  
  // Check if the hardware component identified by code 0x38b is ready
  hardwareStatus = CheckHardwareStatus(0x38b);

  // If the hardware is not ready, then perform the needed initializations
  if (hardwareStatus == 0) {
    ResetHardware(0x38b);         // Reset the hardware component
    EnableHardware(0x38b, true);  // Enable the hardware component
  }

  // Finalize the hardware initialization by setting some related flags to false
  FinalizeHardwareInit(0x38b, false);
  
  return;
}
```

Explanation of changes:
- `FUN_00042100` has been renamed to `InitializeHardwareComponent` to describe the function's purpose of setting up a hardware component.
- `iVar1` has been renamed to `hardwareStatus` for clarity, representing the status of the hardware component after attempting to check its readiness.
- `FUN_000406e4` has been renamed to `CheckHardwareStatus` to indicate that it checks the status of a specific hardware component identified by a code (0x38b in this case).
- `FUN_00040794` has been renamed to `ResetHardware` to indicate that it performs a reset operation on the hardware component.
- `FUN_00040ad8` has been renamed to `EnableHardware` to indicate that it enables the hardware component, with the second argument likely indicating a boolean switch to enable (true) or disable (false).
- `FUN_00040ed4` has been renamed to `FinalizeHardwareInit` to imply that it finalizes the initialization process of the hardware component, possibly by setting flags or performing cleanup operations.

Note: The meaning of the magic number `0x38b` is not clear without further context; it likely identifies a specific hardware component in the system. The number has been kept unchanged as it's specific to the embedded system's hardware configuration.
