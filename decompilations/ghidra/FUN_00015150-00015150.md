Comments have been added to describe the functionality as understood from the given code. Function names and variables have been renamed to make the code more readable. Please note that the code provided by you appears incomplete, as some external symbols and data structures (`s_uninit_temp_info_000607c0` and `s_do_not_read_temp_anymore____000607d4`) are referenced without definition. I have assumed these are external data sources given the context. The function `ProcessTemperatureData` referenced in the original pseudocode is also assumed to be an external function that processes or saves the temperature data passed to it.
