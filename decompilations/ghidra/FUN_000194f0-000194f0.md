**Note**: The following changes have been made:

- The function `FUN_000194f0` has been renamed to `CheckAntminerStatus` for clarity.
- `iVar1`, `iVar2`, and `iVar3` have been replaced with `totalHashrate`, `expectedHashrate`, and `sleepCounter`, respectively, to reflect their roles in the code.
- `acStack_810` has been renamed to `logMessage` for readability.
- `iVar1` being negative check has been simplified using absolute value logic after computations.
- Hypothetical functions `GetCurrentHashrate` and `GetExpectedHashrate` are placeholder names for `FUN_00015508` and `FUN_0001572c`respectively.
- The `DAT_0007eb9c` is assumed to be a variable that holds the logging level, so it's renamed to `loggingLevel`.
- The `FUN_0002e584` function, which appears to be for logging messages, has been renamed to `LogMessage`.
- Comments were added to explain each section of the code and the purpose of the operations within the function.

Replace placeholder function names and variable names with actual ones from your full codebase to preserve functionality. The actual logging level variable and logging function name would need to be replaced according to your specific implementation.
