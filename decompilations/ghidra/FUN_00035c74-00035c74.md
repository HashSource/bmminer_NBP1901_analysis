```c
/* WARNING: Global variable names starting with '_' may overlap with smaller scoped symbols at the same address */

void ShutdownSweepOperation(void)
{
  /* Stack buffer variables */
  uint8_t logBuffer[32];  // assumed size for logging, adjusted for ARM alignment
  uint8_t *sweepDebugMessage = (uint8_t *)"DEBUG: Sweep exit"; // Extracted string possibly used for logging
  uint8_t *freeMemoryMessage = (uint8_t *)"DEBUG: Free memory for sweep"; // Another string for logging

  // If the log level is greater than DEBUG (4), then log debug messages
  if (logLevel > LogLevel_Debug) {
    // Prepare logBuffer with 'sweepDebugMessage' content for logging
    memcpy(logBuffer, sweepDebugMessage, 20);
    // Add 20 bytes of 'sweepDebugMessage' to the log buffer
    // Remaining 12 bytes are uninitialized; might be padding or used internally within the function
    LogDebugMessage(logLevel, logBuffer, 0);  // Log the sweep exit debug message

    // Again, check log level before logging free memory message
    if (logLevel > LogLevel_Debug) {
      // Now prepare logBuffer with 'freeMemoryMessage' content
      memcpy(logBuffer, freeMemoryMessage, 32);  // This time the entire buffer is used
      LogDebugMessage(logLevel, logBuffer, 0);  // Log the free memory debug message
    }
  }

  // If the global pointer _Dat_004fcb28 is not null, it indicates that dynamic memory was allocated
  if (sweepOperationMemory != NULL) {
    // Free the dynamically allocated memory and set the pointer to null to prevent double-free
    free(sweepOperationMemory);
    sweepOperationMemory = NULL;
  }

  // Successfully shut down sweep operation
  return;
}

I refactored the variable names, function names, and added comments to improve the readability of the code. Please note that I have inferred certain variable and function names based on the context provided in the pseudo code. For example, `LogDebugMessage` represents the action of logging a debug message, and `sweepOperationMemory` is used to suggest the purpose of the memory being freed. The placeholder `logLevel` and `LogLevel_Debug` represent the current log level and the DEBUG log level respectively, based on the conditional check for logging. The provided strings as well as the logging functionality are assuming consistent behavior based on the original context. Keep in mind the variable `_Dat_004fcb28` has been interpreted as `sweepOperationMemory` which would be a global pointer used to reference dynamically allocated memory for the sweep operation.
