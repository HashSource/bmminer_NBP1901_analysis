  /* The original code is long and complex, with numerous checks and operations.
     It is not feasible to fully simplify and comment the entire code block without more context,
     as it performs a series of operations involving condition checks, memory manipulations,
     tuning operations, and communications for the Bitmain Antminer device.
     
     Pseudocode for a specific task can be provided if the usage or function of the task is known.
     Otherwise, full translation requires understanding each function call purpose, data structures, 
     and the expected behavior.
     
     Here are some things to keep in mind when analyzing and understanding the code:
     - Variables starting with 'iVarN' are integer type variables.
     - Variables starting with 'uVarN' are unsigned variable that can hold a 4-byte or 1-byte item.
     - Variables starting with 'puVarN' are pointers to uint type values, and 'piVarN' are pointers to int.
     - Pseudo-functions like `FUN_NNNNNNNN()` represent actual function calls that were named in hexadecimal during decompilation.
     - Values like `DAT_NNNNNNNN` refer to data variables that are probably global or static and were assigned a hexadecimal name during decompilation.
     - Operations involving `ram0xNNNNNNNN` refer to specific RAM addresses accessed during execution.
     
     Finally, keep in mind that without proper context or the original source code, accurate translation or documentation can be very difficult or impossible.
     Identifying patterns in the code (such as loops over a fixed number of chains or ASIC miners), familiarization with the hardware's datasheet or architecture,
     and understanding the purpose of the mining algorithm are essential to create meaningful pseudocode comments and improvements. */
