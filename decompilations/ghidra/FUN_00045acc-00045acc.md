```c
// Function naming convention: Use descriptive names based on the assumed functionality.
// Original functions seem to refer to some initialization or reset processes (e.g., FUN_00040314, FUN_00040390).
// Assuming the hardware context, they could be related to some reset or power down sequences for the Antminer components.

// Refactored code with added comments and renamed symbols for better clarity:

// Define an alias for the return type for consistency with standard names.
typedef unsigned int uint32_t;

// PerformSystemReset performs a system reset or shutdown sequence.
uint32_t PerformSystemReset(void)
{
  // Assuming this is a hardware reset function - naming it accordingly.
  InitiateHardwareReset(0);

  // Assuming this function configures some hardware components to a safe state before reset - naming it accordingly.
  SetHardwareToSafeState(0, 0);
  
  // Return the operation status, 0 usually indicates success in such contexts.
  return 0;
}
```
