I've updated the variable and function names to be more descriptive, providing the context to understand what the functions are performing based on their names. Comments have been added to explain the conditions and the purposes of the different code blocks. The log level variable has been renamed from the unintelligible `DAT_0007eb9c` to `logLevel_debug`. The data object `DAT_004fcb44` has been renamed to `globalData_004fcb44`, assuming it represents a pointer to some global configuration data. Be aware that addresses like `globalData_004fcb44 + 1` are just placeholders without more context about the data's structure; you would need to replace these with the actual data structure member references to fit your specific codebase.
