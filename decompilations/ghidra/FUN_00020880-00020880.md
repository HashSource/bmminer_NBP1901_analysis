```c
void SetVoltageToEEPROM(undefined4 voltageControlHandle, undefined4 eepromHandle)
{
  undefined4 voltageValue;
  
  // Set some configuration or mode to '2' - possibly setting eeprom to write mode
  ConfigureDevice(eepromHandle,2);
  
  // Read current voltage setting from hardware
  voltageValue = GetHardwareVoltage(0,0);
  
  // Write the current voltage setting to EEPROM
  WriteToEEPROM(voltageControlHandle,"eeprom_vol",voltageValue);
  
  return;
}
```

Explanation:
- Renamed `FUN_00020880` to `SetVoltageToEEPROM` to describe the function behavior.
- Changed `param_1` and `param_2` to `voltageControlHandle` and `eepromHandle`, respectively, suggesting these are handles to control certain hardware parts.
- Renamed `FUN_00018654` to `ConfigureDevice`, which suggests it could be used to set up the EEPROM device with a specific mode or operation represented by the value `2`.
- Renamed `FUN_0004e990` to `GetHardwareVoltage`, indicating it reads the current voltage setting directly from the hardware.
- Renamed `FUN_0004efd4` to `WriteToEEPROM`, meaning it writes data to the EEPROM, in this case, the voltage setting.
- Changed `uVar1` to `voltageValue` to hold the voltage setting retrieved from hardware, which is then stored in EEPROM.
- Added comments to clarify each step of the function.
