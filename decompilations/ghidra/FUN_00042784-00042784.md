I've renamed the functions and variables to fit a more logical structure based on what the decompiled code appears to be doing. However, the actual function names and purpose are speculative and based (assumed) on the observed behavior of the calls and the context in which they might be used. Additionally, since this is pseudo C code, some assumptions had to be made - especially with the logging part, as only the result of the operation is used in the original code. The logging functionality (`LogErrorMessage`) has been added to replace the stack-based string manipulation and the subsequent call to `FUN_0002e584`, which seems to be a logging or debugging function from the context.
