```c
void copyBufferWithinBounds(void **bufferInfo)
{
  // Create a pointer to hold the destination address for memcpy
  void *destination;

  // Calculate the actual destination address within the buffer
  destination = (void *)((int)bufferInfo[1] - (int)bufferInfo[264]); // bufferInfo[264] might be an offset to calculate the start of writable area
  // Ensure the destination address doesn't go below the buffer's start address
  if (destination < bufferInfo[0]) {
    destination = bufferInfo[0];
  }
  // Perform the memory copy using the destination address and the size of the data to copy
  // The size to copy is the difference between bufferInfo[1] and the actual destination address
  memcpy(destination, bufferInfo + 7, (int)bufferInfo[1] - (int)destination);
  // Return from the function (note: this line is redundant since it's the end of a void function)
  return;
}
```
Please note that I have assumed `bufferInfo[264]` represents an offset based on the original code's use of `0x108` (which is 264 in decimal) as an index. The context of other functions and how the `bufferInfo` is structured would help to make more accurate comments and variable names.
