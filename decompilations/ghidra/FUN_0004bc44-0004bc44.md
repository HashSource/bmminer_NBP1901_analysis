```c
int GetConfigValueByKey(int config_table_ptr, char *key)
{
  // Calculate the string length of the key
  size_t key_length = strlen(key);

  // Hash the key to get the index
  uint index_hash = HashConfigKey(key, key_length, GLOBAL_HASH_SEED);

  // Locate the configuration entry in the table using the hashed index
  int config_entry_ptr = FindConfigEntry(config_table_ptr, *(int *)(config_table_ptr + 4) +
                                         (index_hash & ~(-1 << (*(uint *)(config_table_ptr + 8) & 0xff))) * 8,
                                         key, index_hash);
  // Extract the value from the configuration entry if it's found
  if (config_entry_ptr != 0) {
    config_entry_ptr = *(int *)(config_entry_ptr + 0x14);
  }

  // Return the value associated with the key, or null if not found
  return config_entry_ptr;
}
```

Explanation of modifications:
- Renamed `FUN_0004bc44` to `GetConfigValueByKey` to reflect what the function seems to be doing: getting a value from a configuration table by its key.
- Changed `param_1` to `config_table_ptr`, assuming this is a pointer to a configuration table structure.
- Changed `param_2` to `key`, assuming this is the key we are looking to find in the configuration table.
- Renamed `sVar1` to `key_length`, for clarity on what the variable represents.
- Renamed `uVar2` to `index_hash`, as this seems to be the hashed index derived from the key.
- Renamed `iVar3` to `config_entry_ptr`, to represent the pointer to the found configuration entry.
- Changed `DAT_005051c0` to `GLOBAL_HASH_SEED`, assuming this is a constant value used for hashing. This global variable name was inferred; you may need to replace it with the actual name used in the codebase.
- Rewrote comments to better describe each step of the function.
- Adjusted formatting for consistency and readability.
