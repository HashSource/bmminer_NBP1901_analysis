```c
void SetUARTBaudRate(int baudRate)
{
  char logMessage[2048];
  
  // If the baud rate is higher than 3000000, perform specific initializations
  if (baudRate > 3000000) {
    InitializeCommunicationSettings();
    DelayMilliseconds(100);
  }

  // If the global debug level is greater than 3, log the baud rate change
  if (debugLogLevel > 3) {
    snprintf(logMessage, sizeof(logMessage), "set UART baud to %d\n", baudRate);
    WriteToLog(3, logMessage, 0);
  }

  // Configure the hardware to set the new UART baud rate
  ConfigureHardwareForBaudRate(baudRate);

  // Re-initialize input/output settings
  InitializeIOSettings();

  // Reset input/output buffers
  ResetIOBuffers();

  return;
}
```

**Comments:**

- `FUN_00028138` is renamed to `SetUARTBaudRate` to reflect what the function does, it's setting the baud rate for a UART communication.
- `acStack_808` is a local buffer for building a log message. It's renamed to `logMessage` to reflect its use.
- The constant `3000000` is likely related to a maximum baud rate after which some initialization is needed, hinted by `FUN_0001eb74`. This is renamed to `InitializeCommunicationSettings`.
- `DAT_0007eb9c` is probably a global debug level variable, renamed to `debugLogLevel`.
- `FUN_0001e9cc` seems to be configuring the hardware with the new baud rate so it's renamed to `ConfigureHardwareForBaudRate`.
- `FUN_0001e160` is suggested to be initializing I/O settings, so it's renamed to `InitializeIOSettings`.
- `FUN_00014f20` is assumed to reset the I/O buffers, thus renamed to `ResetIOBuffers`.
- `FUN_0002e584` could be a logging function, named `WriteToLog`.
- `FUN_000304d4` is likely introducing a delay, named `DelayMilliseconds`.
