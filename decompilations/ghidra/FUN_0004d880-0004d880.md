```c
// Function to possibly reset or stop mining operation based on 'operationMode' parameter.
// It is likely being called with 'operationMode' to decide what operation to perform.
void performOperationBasedOnMode(int operationMode) {
  // If 'operationMode' is set to 0 (which may represent a NO-OP or STOP operation), do nothing
  if (operationMode == 0) {
    return;
  }

  // Call the function pointed to by the function pointer 'fnPtrResetOrStopMining' to execute the operation.
  // This function pointer is likely initialized somewhere else in the program
  // and points to a function that resets or stops the mining operation.
  (*fnPtrResetOrStopMining)();
  
  return;
}
