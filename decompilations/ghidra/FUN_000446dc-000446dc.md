```c
void RestartMinerProcess(void)
{
  // Request to terminate the mining process gracefully
  SignalMinerProcessTermination(0xd);
  
  // Forcefully terminate the mining process if it doesn't stop gracefully
  ForceTerminateMinerProcess(0xd, 0xffff);
  
  // Wait for 2 seconds to give the system time to clean up
  sleep(2);
  
  // Function completes, mining process should be restarted by a watcher or script
