```c
int calculateTotal(int miningChipIndex, int baseAddress)
{
  int chipCount;
  int totalValue;
  int *currentValuePtr;
  int counter;
  
  chipCount = getChipCount(); // Assume this function returns the number of mining chips
  if (chipCount > 0) {
    totalValue = 0;
    counter = 0;
    currentValuePtr = (int *)(baseAddress + miningChipIndex * 0x400 - 4);
    do {
      counter = counter + 1;
      currentValuePtr = currentValuePtr + 1;
      totalValue = totalValue + *currentValuePtr;
    } while (chipCount != counter);
    return totalValue;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of changes:
- Changed function name `FUN_00026f34` to `calculateTotal` to better describe its purpose.
- Renamed `param_1` to `miningChipIndex` and `param_2` to `baseAddress` to clarify what they represent.
- `iVar1` was renamed to `chipCount` to be more descriptive.
- `iVar2` was renamed to `totalValue` to indicate that it is accumulating a total.
- `piVar3` was renamed to `currentValuePtr` to make it clear it's a pointer to the current value being read.
- `iVar4` was renamed to `counter` as it's used to count iterations in the loop.
- Added comments and made assumptions about what `FUN_0001e0f0` might represent, renaming it to `getChipCount` for clarity.
