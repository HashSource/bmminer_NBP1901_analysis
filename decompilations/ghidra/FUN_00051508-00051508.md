```c
#include <unistd.h> // Include for usleep function

// Function declaration with more descriptive names
// The function seems to modify some hardware-related registers, probably related to miner operations
uint32_t SetRegisterBit(uint32_t registerAddress, uint32_t registerValue) {

  // Local array to store the value read from a hardware register
  uint32_t registerBuffer[2];
  
  // Read the register at the specified address into registerBuffer
  // The original function name and parameters are not clear, renamed for clarity
  ReadHardwareRegister(1, registerAddress, registerValue, 0xb0, registerBuffer);
  
  // Set the 5th bit (0x10) in the register's value
  registerBuffer[0] = registerBuffer[0] | 0x10;
  
  // Write the modified value back to the hardware register
  WriteHardwareRegister(registerAddress, 0, registerValue, 0xb0, registerBuffer[0]);
  
  // Wait for 30 milliseconds perhaps to ensure that the register write settles
  usleep(30000);
  
  // Return 0 which may indicate success
  return 0;
}
```

**Note:** Since the actual purpose and context of the functions `FUN_00051a20` and `FUN_0004fa10` are not provided, they have been renamed `ReadHardwareRegister` and `WriteHardwareRegister`, respectively, as they appear to read and write to some sort of hardware register. The literal `0xb0` is kept unchanged, but should be replaced with a macro or constant that indicates its purpose if known. The exact meaning of the register bits and operations should be further documented once the relevant information is available.
