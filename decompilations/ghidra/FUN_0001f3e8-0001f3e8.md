Please note that in the pseudocode provided, global variable names such as `DAT_00590404`, `DAT_00482a5c`, `DAT_0007eba0`, and `DAT_0001f48c`, and the functions such as `FUN_0002e584`, `FUN_0001e28c`, `FUN_0004e990`, and `FUN_0004efd4` have been renamed to representative names based on their assumed functionality. These names are guesses, and in a real reverse-engineering situation, their true purpose would need to be confirmed by analyzing their usage in the broader context of the software. The comments have been added to describe the steps in the function.
