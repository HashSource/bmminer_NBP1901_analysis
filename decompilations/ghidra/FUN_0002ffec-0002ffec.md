```c
void convertTimestampToSecondsAndMicroseconds(unsigned int *outputBuffer)
{
  unsigned int timestampHighPart; // Placeholder for the high part of the timestamp (seconds)
  unsigned int timestampLowPart;  // Placeholder for the low part of the timestamp (microseconds)
  unsigned int microsecondsPart;  // Placeholder to store the calculated microseconds
  
  // Calculate seconds and microseconds from a given 64-bit timestamp split into two 32-bit parts.
  // The timestamp is in the format of a 64-bit value where the high part is on the top of the stack
  // (in_stack_ffffffe4, corresponding to the high 32 bits) and the low part is the next in the stack
  // (in_stack_ffffffe0, corresponding to the low 32 bits). The calculation divides this 64-bit value
  // by 1000000 to convert it from microseconds to seconds, with the remainder as microseconds.
  lldiv((lldiv_t *)&timestampHighPart, 1000000, CONCAT44(timestampHighPart, timestampLowPart));
  
  // Store the calculated seconds in the output buffer
  *outputBuffer = timestampLowPart;
  // Store the calculated microseconds in the next position of the output buffer
  outputBuffer[1] = microsecondsPart;

  return;
}
```

**Note**: In this code, `CONCAT44` most likely represents a macro or function to concatenate two 32-bit values (`timestampHighPart` and `timestampLowPart`) into a 64-bit value for the division operation. The `lldiv` function performs long long division (dividing one 64-bit value by another, in this case, 1000000) and stores the result somewhere. If `lldiv` or `CONCAT44` are not standard functions/macros in the provided development environment, you may need further context or proper headers to determine their definitions or how they should be implemented.
