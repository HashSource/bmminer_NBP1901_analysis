```c
void SetASICBoostParameters(undefined4 chipAddress, undefined4 chainIndex)
{
  uint boostConfig;

  // This function might be reading the current boost configuration from the ASIC
  GetASICBoostConfig(1, chipAddress, chainIndex, 0x18, &boostConfig);

  // Modifying specific bits in the configuration to enable the desired ASIC boost state
  // The bitwise operation is clearing certain bits (with the & 0xffffff8f mask) and
  // setting new values (with the | 0x4030) to enable some mode or feature.
  boostConfig = (boostConfig & 0xFFFFFF8F) | 0x4030;

  // This function might write the new boost configuration back to the ASIC
  WriteASICBoostConfig(chipAddress, 0, chainIndex, 0x18, boostConfig);

  return;
}
```

Please note that the actual operation performed by the binary data can only be fully understood with more context on the functions being called and the hardware interaction. The pseudo C code provided has been renamed with assumed functionality and parameters based on typical operations on mining hardware ASICs. The magic numbers 0x18 and 0x4030 and their significance would ideally be defined as constants with meaningful names, but without additional context, it is not possible to give them descriptive names.
