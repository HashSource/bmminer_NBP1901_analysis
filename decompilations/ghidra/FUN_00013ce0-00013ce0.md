```c
void CheckAndUpdateFanSpeeds(uint minFanSpeed)
{
  uint fanIndex;
  undefined4 fanControlState;
  uint currentSpeed;
  uint fanSpeed;
  char outputBuffer[2048]; // Buffer to hold the output string for debugging
  
  fanIndex = 0;
  while(true) {
    currentSpeed = GetConnectedFanCount(); // Assume this function gets the number of fans connected
    fanSpeed = fanIndex & 0xff;
    if (currentSpeed <= fanIndex) break;
    fanSpeed = ReadFanSpeed(fanSpeed); // Assume this function reads the RPM of a given fan
    if (-1 < (int)fanSpeed) {
      // Debug threshold value (DAT_0007eb9c) moved outside the loop or turned into a constant for performance and readability
      // Constants should be named at the top of the file or within an appropriate configuration section
      if (4 < DEBUG_LEVEL) {
        snprintf(outputBuffer,0x800,"fan[%u] speed[%u]\n",fanSpeed,fanSpeed);
        DebugPrint(4, outputBuffer, 0); // Assume this function prints out debugging information
      }
      UpdateFanStatus(fanSpeed, fanSpeed); // Assume this function updates some status based on the fan's RPM
      if ((9999 < (int)fanSpeed) || (fanControlState = 1, fanSpeed < minFanSpeed)) {
        fanControlState = 0; // 0 probably indicates a need to increase fan speed or signal a fault
      }
      ControlFan(fanSpeed, fanControlState); // Assume this function controls the fan based on the control state determined
    }
    fanIndex = fanIndex + 1;
  }
  return;

I have renamed the functions, parameters, and variables to give them more descriptive names and added comments to explain what I assume each part of the code is doing based on the typical functions dealing with fan speeds and control in an embedded system. The values like DEBUG_LEVEL or constants should be defined elsewhere in the code for context and readability. The specific function of some code sections, such as the condition `if (-1 < (int)fanSpeed)`, depends on a more thorough understanding of the rest of the system, which I've inferred as being a check for a valid fan speed readout.
