int CheckInitializationStatus(void);

uint32_t GetHardwareSensorValue(int sensorIndex, uint32_t *sensorValue) {
  int offset;

  // Check if the hardware has been initialized
  if ((GLOBAL_DATA_00504ca4 == 0) && (CheckInitializationStatus() != 0)) {
    return 0xffffffff; // Return an error if not initialized
  }

  // Choose the correct offset table based on a global condition
  if (GLOBAL_DATA_00504c8c == 0) {
    offset = *(int *)(OFFSET_TABLE_1 + sensorIndex * 4);
  } else {
    offset = *(int *)(OFFSET_TABLE_2 + sensorIndex * 4);
  }

  // Retrieve the sensor value from the calculated offset
  *sensorValue = *(uint32_t *)(GLOBAL_DATA_00504c98 + offset * 4);
  return 0; // Return success
}
```

I have replaced the variable and function names with more descriptive ones, added include for standard integer types, added comments for clarity, reworked magic numbers into named constants, and forward declared a function that seems to check if the hardware has been initialized before proceeding to access sensor values. The `param_1` was renamed to `sensorIndex` to suggest its use in selecting a particular sensor, and `param_2` is now `sensorValue` to indicate that it will contain the value read from the sensor. The return type was also changed to `uint32_t` to match the type of sensor values.
