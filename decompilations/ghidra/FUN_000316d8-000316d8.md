```c
uint calculateCRC32(byte *data, int length) {
  byte *currentBytePtr;
  uint crcValue;
  byte *nextBytePtr;

  // If there's data to process
  if (length != 0) {
    crcValue = 0xffffffff; // Initialize CRC value with starting seed
    nextBytePtr = data; // Set the next byte pointer to the start of the data

    // Process each byte of the data
    do {
      currentBytePtr = nextBytePtr + 1; // Move to the next byte

      // Calculate the CRC for the current byte using the lookup table (0x00065fa4 points to the start of the table in memory)
      crcValue = *(uint *)(&lookupTable + ((*nextBytePtr ^ crcValue) & 0xff) * 4) ^ crcValue >> 8;

      nextBytePtr = currentBytePtr; // Update the next byte pointer to the current byte pointer
    } while (currentBytePtr != data + length); // Repeat until we've processed all bytes

    return ~crcValue; // Return the complement of the final CRC value
  }

  // If there's no data to process, simply return 0
  return 0;
}
```

Please note, that the original code referred to `DAT_00065fa4`, which appears to be a hardcoded address where the CRC lookup table is stored. In the modified pseudocode, I've replaced this with `lookupTable` to describe its purpose, but you'll need to replace this with the actual name or address of the table in your code.

Also, ensure the `lookupTable` is properly declared and initialized elsewhere in your codebase for this function to work correctly.

Comments have been added throughout the code to clarify the purpose of each line and variable.
