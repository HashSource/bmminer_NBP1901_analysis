Remember that the names given here are educated guesses based on what the code seems to be doing. Without further context or comments in the original code, it's difficult to provide accurate names. The names should be adjusted to fit the true purpose and functionality as revealed by the entire codebase and documentation of the Bitmain Antminer system.
