```c
void CheckAndUpdateMinerStatus(uint requestedMinerID, undefined4 status)
{
  undefined4 updatedStatus;
  uint currentMinerID;
  undefined8 minerCheckResult;
  
  currentMinerID = 0; // Initialize the current miner ID to start from the first miner
  do {
    // Check the status of the current miner
    minerCheckResult = CheckMinerStatus(currentMinerID, status);
    updatedStatus = (undefined4)((ulonglong)minerCheckResult >> 0x20); // High 32 bits of the result
  
    if ((int)minerCheckResult != 0) {
      // If there is an issue with the miner, set the status to indicate an error (1)
      updatedStatus = 1;
      // If a specific miner is requested or the broadcast ID (0xff) is used, update the miner's indicator
      if (requestedMinerID == currentMinerID || requestedMinerID == 0xff) {
        UpdateMinerIndicator(currentMinerID & 0xff); // Update the indicator LED or similar
        updatedStatus = updatedStatus; // After updating the indicator, get the new status (potentially unnecessary line)
      }
    }
    currentMinerID += 1; // Move to check the next miner
  } while (currentMinerID != 4); // Continue until all 4 miners have been checked
  return;
}
```

Comments have been added throughout the code, and symbol names have been updated to make the purpose and flow of the function clearer. The function appears to check and update the status (e.g. error conditions) of up to four miners and their respective indicators, which could be hardware LEDs. It only updates a specific miner if its ID matches the `requestedMinerID`, or if a broadcast ID is used to update all miners. The code snippet seems incomplete without the rest of the context, so some assumptions had to be made about the functionality based on common practices.
