In this refactored code:

- `FUN_00020788` has been renamed to `UpdateSerialNumber` which seems to be the purpose of the function based on the fact that it's dealing with serial numbers and a socket file descriptor.
- `param_1` has been renamed to `socket_fd` as it is used as a file descriptor for a socket, judging by the usage in `FUN_0004efd4`.
- `param_2` has been renamed to `hashboard_index` since it is being used to index some element (likely a hashboard given the context of the Antminer hardware).
- `FUN_00017fd8` has been renamed to `ReadHashboardSerialNumber` to infer its purpose of reading a serial number from a hashboard.
- `FUN_0004e744` has been renamed to `StandardizeSerialNumber` to suggest its purpose might be to convert the serial number into a standard format.
- `FUN_0004efd4` has been renamed to `SendSerialNumberToSocket` to represent its possible purpose of sending a serial number over a socket connection.
- `DAT_00590404`, `DAT_00482a5c`, and `DAT_0007eba0` have been renamed to `SystemIsReady`, `AnotherCondition`, and `SomeCounter` respectively; these names are placeholders representing whatever role these globals play, which should be determined with more context.
- `DAT_0002087c` has been renamed to `FunctionName` which seems to be a placeholder for the name of the current function or another relevant identifier, used for logging.
- `FUN_0002e584` has been renamed to `LogError` since it seems to log error messages with severity or types - in this case, type '3'. The meaning of '3' should be derived from additional context or documentation.
- Comments have been added to aid in understanding the purpose of each step of the function.
