```c
void ReleaseResourceWithDecrement(int resourceController, undefined4 newValue) {
  bool hasAccess;
  int resourceCounter;
  int *resourceCounterPtr;

  // Obtain the resource counter value from the offset within the resource controller
  resourceCounter = *(int *)(resourceController + 0xC);

  // Check if the resource is initialized and not in an error state
  if ((resourceCounter != 0) && (*(int *)(resourceCounter + 4) != -1)) {
    // Setup a pointer to the reference count of the resource
    resourceCounterPtr = (int *)(resourceCounter + 4);
    
    // Data Memory Barrier for synchronization before accessing shared data
    DataMemoryBarrier(0xB);

    // Loop until we have exclusive access to the counter
    do {
      // Read the current value of the resource counter
      resourceCounter = *resourceCounterPtr;
      // Check if we have exclusive access to modify the resource counter
      hasAccess = (bool)hasExclusiveAccess(resourceCounterPtr);
    } while (!hasAccess); // Continue trying until exclusive access

    // Decrement the resource counter safely
    *resourceCounterPtr = resourceCounter - 1;
    
    // If the resource counter reaches 0, release it and assign new value to controller
    if (resourceCounter - 1 == 0) {
      ReleaseResource();
      *(undefined4 *)(resourceController + 0xC) = newValue;
      return;

  // If not releasing the resource, simply assign the new value to the resource controller
  *(undefined4 *)(resourceController + 0xC) = newValue;
  return;
}
```

In the modified code:

- Renamed function `FUN_0004bec0` to `ReleaseResourceWithDecrement`.
- Renamed `param_1` to `resourceController`, an assumed identifier for the controller handling resources.
- Renamed `param_2` to `newValue`, to represent the new value to set for the resource counter.
- Added a variable `hasAccess` to store the result of `hasExclusiveAccess`.
- Renamed `iVar2` to `resourceCounter`, representing the count of references or uses of the resource.
- Renamed `piVar3` to `resourceCounterPtr`, pointing to the actual resource counter in memory.
- Renamed `bVar1` to `hasAccess`.
- Renamed `FUN_0004eb6c` to `ReleaseResource`, representing a call to release the resource.
- Added comments throughout the code to explain each step.
