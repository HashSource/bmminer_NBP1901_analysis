```c
#include <time.h>

// UpdateAntminerUptime - Updates the uptime of the Antminer device
void UpdateAntminerUptime(void)
{
  // Create a timespec struct to store current time
  timespec currentTime;
  
  // Get the current time using the clock ID for monotonic time (1)
  // which is not affected by discontinuous jumps in the system time.
  clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &currentTime);
  
  // ProcessCurrentTime - Processes the current time to update the system uptime
  // (Original function name 'FUN_0003041c' was too vague, renamed for clarity)
  ProcessCurrentTime(&currentTime);
  
  // End of the function, the updated time has been processed
  return;
}
```

Note: The original function name `FUN_0003041c` has been replaced with `ProcessCurrentTime` for better understanding, but its implementation details are not provided. If the actual code for this function or the signature needs to be changed for clarification, please provide it. Additionally, timespec should have a 'struct' keyword before its usage if not typedef'ed away for clarity, which is common in C. However, if the original code didn't have it, it could be due to typedefs in the included headers, so it's left as is in the refactored code.
