Please note that the code is based on decompiled output which could be imprecise or incorrect in some aspects. Decompiled variable names and function calls may not accurately reflect the original source code naming conventions or library calls. Hence, variables were renamed based on assumptions derived from their usage, and function names were speculated based on typical functionality that the decompiled names might suggest. Comments are added for clarity. Adjustments were also made on the assumption that the `nonceCountBuffer` holds formatted string for logging and `nonceReportBuffer` potentially stores data for log output which may need to be converted into a string.
