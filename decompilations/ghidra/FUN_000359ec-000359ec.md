```c
// GetPointerToDataBlock - Returns a pointer to a specific data block in memory
// This function appears to return the address of a global data block.
// The data block label (DAT_004fcae8) is an address placeholder and should be renamed 
// to reflect the purpose or content of the actual data being pointed to, if known.

undefined4 * GetPointerToDataBlock(void)
{
  // Pointer to a global data block; rename 'GlobalDataBlock' to represent the actual data.
  static undefined4 *GlobalDataBlock = &GlobalDataBlockContents; 

  return GlobalDataBlock; // Return the pointer to the data block
}
```

For the `GlobalDataBlockContents` symbol, replace it with a more meaningful name if the purpose or contents of this data is known from the broader context of the software. The `undefined4` type indicates that it's a 32-bit unknown data type. If the actual data type is known (for example, a configuration structure or a status register), the type definition and the variable name should be updated accordingly for clarity.
