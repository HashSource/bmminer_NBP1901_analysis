```c
#include <pthread.h>

// Assume that this mutex and these variables are defined
// elsewhere globally, as they are not in the scope of the function
extern pthread_mutex_t globalMutex;
extern int globalValue1;
extern int globalValue2;

// This is a more user-friendly name for the function
// that was originally named FUN_000316d8.
int performSomeOperation(int value1, int value2);

// Renamed function to reflect what it's possibly doing,
// e.g., synchronizing and performing an operation.
int synchronizedOperation(void)
{
  int result;
  
  // Lock the mutex before accessing shared resources
  pthread_mutex_lock(&globalMutex);
  
  // Perform an operation using shared resources
  // It's not clear what the original function does just from the name.
  // The function has been renamed to 'performSomeOperation' for better clarity.
  result = performSomeOperation(globalValue1, globalValue2);
  
  // Unlock the mutex after the shared resources are no longer needed
  pthread_mutex_unlock(&globalMutex);
  
  // Return the result of the operation
  return result;
}
```

Note: It is important to remember that while renaming the symbols and variables can make the code easier to read and understand, it is critical to ensure that the new names accurately represent the functionality. Since the original names and operation of the code are not clear without more context, I've made some assumptions for the example renaming here. Adjustments might be necessary with more details or understanding of the decompiled code's original purpose.
