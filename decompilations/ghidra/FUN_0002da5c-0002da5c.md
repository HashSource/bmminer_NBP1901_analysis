```c
int InitializeMinerHardware(int hardwareConfig)
{
  int minerHardwarePtr;
  
  minerHardwarePtr = GetMinerHardwareInstance();
  if (minerHardwarePtr != 0) {
    // Clear the memory block associated with the hardware, setting the memory block to zero
    memset(*(void **)(minerHardwarePtr + 0xc), 0, *(size_t *)(hardwareConfig + 0x14));
  }
  return minerHardwarePtr;
}

// Comments:
// - Function name changed from FUN_0002da5c to InitializeMinerHardware for clarity.
// - Parameter name changed from param_1 to hardwareConfig, assuming that it represents some configuration structure.
// - Variable iVar1 is renamed as minerHardwarePtr as it likely represents a pointer to miner hardware state or similar context.
// - The function GetMinerHardwareInstance (previously FUN_0002d9d4) presumably returns a pointer to miner hardware instance.
// - The magic numbers (offsets 0xc and 0x14) used within the struct pointed by minerHardwarePtr and hardwareConfig likely represent structured data offsets that should be given meaningful names if the struct's layout is known.
// - The memset call zeroes out the configuration specific part of the miner hardware instance.
