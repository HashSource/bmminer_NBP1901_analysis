```

Note: 
- `0xb` is assumed to be the size of the buffer that should be large enough to store a string representation of the pointer. Adjust accordingly to the target system pointer size representation.
- The included prototypes `WriteStringToEEPROM`, `CheckIfStringInEEPROM`, and `GetSystemTimeSeconds` are placeholders. Their actual definitions should exist elsewhere in the code, and you need to ensure they correctly correspond to the decompiled function names `FUN_0004bc44`, `FUN_0004eb60`, and `FUN_0004b9b0`.
- If the original function is using constants or type definitions that are specific to the project, they should be included or adapted in the rewritten code for correctness.
- Some assumptions have been made due to the lack of context from the original code snippet. If more information becomes available, further refinements might be needed.
