```c
void disableASICBoostMode(undefined4 ASIC_ID)
{
  uint ASIC_configuration;

  //  Read ASIC configuration: address 0, data ASIC_ID, command 0x34, store in ASIC_configuration
  readASICConfiguration(0, ASIC_ID, 0, 0x34, &ASIC_configuration);
  
  // Disable boost mode by clearing the least significant bit (bit 0) of the ASIC configuration
  ASIC_configuration = ASIC_configuration & 0xFFFFFFFE;

  // Write back the modified configuration: data ASIC_ID, mode 1, command 0x34, write ASIC_configuration
  writeASICConfiguration(ASIC_ID, 1, 0, 0x34, ASIC_configuration);

  // End of function, ASIC boost mode is disabled
  return;
}

* `FUN_00050f28` is renamed to `disableASICBoostMode` to reflect its functionality.
* `param_1` is renamed to `ASIC_ID` as it probably refers to a specific ASIC on the mining system.
* `FUN_00051a20` is renamed to `readASICConfiguration` assuming it reads the configuration for an ASIC.
* `FUN_0004fa10` is renamed to `writeASICConfiguration` assuming it writes a new configuration to an ASIC.
* `local_c` is renamed to `ASIC_configuration` to describe the variable holding the ASIC's current configuration state.
* The magic number `0x34` seems to be a command or register address, kept as-is since there's no provided context for its meaning.
* Comments are added to clarify each step of the function and the purpose of the individual instructions.
