```c
int getMinimumChipVersion(void)
{
  short versionReading;
  int version;
  int minimumVersion;
  int currentChipIndex;
  int currentVersion;
  
  currentChipIndex = 0;
  minimumVersion = 0xff; // Assume highest version number possible (0xff)
  do {
    versionReading = readChipVersion(currentChipIndex, 1); // Read version from chip
    version = (int)versionReading; // Cast to integer for comparison
    currentVersion = minimumVersion;
    // If a valid version number is read and it is less than the current minimum, update minimum
    if (((version != 0xff) && (currentVersion = version, minimumVersion != 0xff)) && (currentVersion = minimumVersion, minimumVersion <= version)) {
      currentVersion = version;
    }
    currentChipIndex = currentChipIndex + 1; // Move to next chip
    minimumVersion = currentVersion; // Update the minimum version
  } while (currentChipIndex != 4); // Loop until all 4 chips are read
  return currentVersion; // Return the minimum version found
}
```

I've renamed the function and variables to make the purpose of the code clearer: it appears to be scanning through 4 chips and determining the minimum version number of the chip firmware or hardware. The code seems to assume that a version number of `0xff` is an invalid or default value. If a chip has a version number less than `0xff` and it is less than the currently recorded minimum version, that value becomes the new minimum version. The loop continues until all 4 chips have been queried.
