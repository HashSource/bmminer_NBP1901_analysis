```c
void compareStringArguments(char **firstArg, char **secondArg)
{
  // Compare two strings pointed by the provided arguments
  strcmp(*firstArg, *secondArg);
  // The function just compares the strings but does not use the comparison result
  return;
}
```
Note: The function name `compareStringArguments` and the argument names `firstArg` and `secondArg` have been chosen to reflect the intention of the code more clearly. The original code could be part of a larger function where the result of `strcmp` is used elsewhere, but within this snippet, the result of the comparison is not utilized.
