```c
void InitializeMinerHardware(void)
{
  int hardwareInitializationStatus;
  
  // Check if the miner hardware is already initialized
  hardwareInitializationStatus = CheckMinerHardwareInitialized(0x38b);
 
  // If the hardware is not initialized, initialize it
  if (hardwareInitializationStatus == 0) {
    SetMinerHardwareInitializedFlag(0x38b);
    PerformMinerHardwareSetup(0x38b, true);
  }

  // Enable miner hardware operations
  EnableMinerHardwareOperations(0x38b, true);
  
  return;
}
```

Comments have been added to describe the purpose of the different steps in the `InitializeMinerHardware` function. The names of the functions and variables have been changed to more clearly reflect their presumed functionality, assuming the functions interact with miner hardware initialization, status checks, and setting operational flags. Please note that the magic number `0x38b` has been kept unchanged due to lack of context on what it represents; it could be an address, an ID, or an error code specific to the hardware.
