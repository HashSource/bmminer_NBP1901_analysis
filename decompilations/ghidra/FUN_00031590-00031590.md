```c
// This function appears to be a checksum or CRC calculation function.
// It takes a pointer to data (input_buffer) and a length (data_length),
// and returns a computed checksum value.
uint CalculateChecksum(int input_buffer, int data_length)
{
  byte *current_byte;   // Pointer to the current byte to process
  uint checksum_low;    // Low byte of the checksum
  uint computed_value;  // Computed intermediate value in checksum calculation
  uint checksum_high;   // High byte of the checksum
  
  // If data length is zero, no checksum can be calculated, so return 0xffff.
  if (data_length != 0) {
    checksum_low = 0xff;        // Initialize low byte of the checksum
    current_byte = (byte *)(input_buffer - 1);  // Set current byte pointer to one byte before data
    checksum_high = 0xff;       // Initialize high byte of the checksum
    
    // Loop over each byte in the input buffer
    do {
      current_byte++;  // Move to the next byte
      computed_value = checksum_low ^ *current_byte;  // Compute using XOR with the current byte
      
      // Update the checksum using lookup tables and computed value.
      // The tables are located in specific addresses (DAT_00065da4 and DAT_00065ea4),
      // likely generated during the checksum algorithm initialization.
      checksum_low = ((byte)(&DAT_00065da4)[computed_value]) ^ checksum_high;  
      checksum_high = (uint)(byte)(&DAT_00065ea4)[computed_value];
      
      // Keep looping until the end of the buffer is reached
    } while ((byte *)(input_buffer + (data_length - 1U & 0xffff)) != current_byte);
    
    // Return the combined checksum value with high byte shifted by 8 bits.
    return checksum_low | checksum_high << 8;
  }
  
  // If data_length was zero, return the default checksum value of 0xffff.
  return 0xffff;
}
```

Note: The decompiled code is not very clear about the origin or content of `&DAT_00065da4` and `&DAT_00065ea4`. These are addresses of lookup tables used in checksum calculation, and would need to be known in order to reproduce this function in a practical setting. They also affect the function's understanding, but as requested, the logic and structure remain the same, with symbols renamed for clarity.
