```c
void updateASICNumber(int logFileDescriptor, unsigned int asicIndex) {
  int asicCount;
  char asicCountStr[10];
  char logBuffer[2048];  // Log message buffer

  // Check for valid log file descriptor and ASIC index range
  if (logFileDescriptor != 0 && asicIndex < 4) {
    asicCount = getASICCount(asicIndex);  // Get the number of ASICs for the given index
    formatAsInteger(asicCount, asicCountStr);  // Format ASIC count as a string
    writeLogEntry(logFileDescriptor, "asic_num", asicCountStr);  // Write ASIC count to log
    return;
  }

  // Additional checks for global variables related to logging and system state
  if ((deviceLoggingEnabled != '\0') || (debugLoggingEnabled != '\0') || (systemStateVariable > 2)) {
    snprintf(logBuffer, sizeof(logBuffer), "%s: input bad param\n", logPrefix);  // Format log message
    writeToLog(3, logBuffer, 0);  // Write log message with log level 3
  }
  return;
}
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

- The function `FUN_0001fdd8` has been renamed to `updateASICNumber` to provide a more descriptive name.
- The first parameter `param_1` has been renamed to `logFileDescriptor` to represent its use as a file descriptor for logging.
- The second parameter `param_2` has been renamed to `asicIndex` to represent its use as an index for selecting an ASIC.
- `iVar1` has been renamed to `asicCount` to indicate its purpose of holding the number of ASICs.
- `uVar2` has been replaced with `asicCountStr`, which is now declared as a character array with a size suitable to hold a string representation of `asicCount`.
- `acStack_808` has been renamed to `logBuffer` for clarity, with the size adjusted to match the correct declaration of a buffer for logging.
- `FUN_0001e67c` has been renamed to `getASICCount` to clarify the function's purpose of getting the count of ASICs.
- `FUN_0004e990` has been replaced with `formatAsInteger`, reflecting the action of formatting an integer as a string.
- `FUN_0004efd4` has been replaced with `writeLogEntry`, which clearly indicates writing to a log.
- The global variables `DAT_00590404`, `DAT_00482a5c`, and `DAT_0007eba0` have been renamed to `deviceLoggingEnabled`, `debugLoggingEnabled`, and `systemStateVariable`, respectively, to indicate their roles within the code.
- The global variable `DAT_0001fe98` has been renamed to `logPrefix` to indicate that it is used as a prefix in log messages.
- `FUN_0002e584` has been renamed to `writeToLog` to indicate functionality clearly.
- Comments have been added to describe what each part of the function does.
