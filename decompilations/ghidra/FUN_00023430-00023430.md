```c
void initializeSha256StateAndProcessData(
  undefined4 dataBuffer,
  int dataLength,
  undefined4 finalBlockBitLength
)
{
  // Initialize SHA-256 hash values
  // These words were obtained by taking the first thirty-two bits of the fractional parts
  // of the square roots of the first eight prime numbers.
  undefined4 hashA = 0x6a09e667;
  undefined4 hashB = 0xbb67ae85;
  undefined4 hashC = 0x3c6ef372;
  undefined4 hashD = 0xa54ff53a;
  undefined4 hashE = 0x510e527f;
  undefined4 hashF = 0x9b05688c;
  undefined4 hashG = 0x1f83d9ab;
  undefined4 hashH = 0x5be0cd19;

  // Temporary variables used during the hash computation
  undefined4 temp1 = 0;
  undefined4 temp2 = 0;

  // Only process the data if the length is greater than zero
  if (dataLength > 0) {
    // Function to process the data in blocks
    processSha256DataBlocks(&temp1, dataBuffer, dataLength);
  }

  // Function to process the final block and pad the message
  finalizeSha256Processing(&temp1, finalBlockBitLength);
  return;
}
```

This code appears to be an initialization and processing function for SHA-256 hashing. The variables are renamed to reflect their purpose in the hashing algorithm, and the functions that it calls are assumed to process data in blocks and finalize the hash computation. Additional comments are added for clarification.
