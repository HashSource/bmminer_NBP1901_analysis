```c
void shutdownMinerIfRequired(int shutdownRequested)
{
  // Check if a shutdown has been requested
  if (shutdownRequested == 0) {
    // If not requested, do nothing and return
    return;
  }

  // Perform the shutdown process
  initiateShutdownProcedure();
  // No further action is taken after initiating shutdown
  return;
}
```

Note: The function `FUN_0004beb8` has been renamed to `initiateShutdownProcedure` to reflect a more descriptive name suggesting it starts the shutdown process. The parameter `param_1` has been renamed to `shutdownRequested` which is a boolean-like value indicating if a shutdown has been requested (`1`) or not (`0`).
