Note: The example above is a partial rewrite, and due to the nature of the code, there are many ambiguous parts. Decompiling code does not give exact variable names, function names, or their purposes without context and understanding of the surrounding system and the hardware being communicated with. The shared lines represent an attempt to clarify some portions, but without full context or the rest of the code, it is a partial effort. Also, standard functions like `memset` and `memcpy` should not be renamed, but here their usage has been marked as custom-named wrapper functions which might be performing additional logging or error-checking specific to the application.
