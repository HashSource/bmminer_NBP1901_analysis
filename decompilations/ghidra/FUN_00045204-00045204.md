```c
#include <stdint.h>

#define REG_CONTROL_STATUS 0x24 // Assumed register address for control/status, based on context

uint32_t UpdateControlRegister(int controlBits)
{
  uint16_t controlRegValue[2]; // Buffer to read control register value
  uint32_t tempStackBuffer;    // Temporary buffer for stack alignment or extra storage

  // Read the current value of the control/status register
  ReadRegister(REG_CONTROL_STATUS, controlRegValue);

  // Update the control/status register with the new control bits,
  // while preserving the original lower 16 bits
  WriteRegister(REG_CONTROL_STATUS, (uint32_t)controlRegValue[0] | (controlBits << 16));

  // Read the updated value back into a temporary buffer (likely for verification)
  ReadRegister(REG_CONTROL_STATUS, &tempStackBuffer);

  // Return success status
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the changes:
- Renamed `FUN_00045204` to `UpdateControlRegister` to better reflect its functionality.
- Renamed `param_1` to `controlBits` to indicate that these are control bits that will be written to a control/status register.
- Changed the return type `undefined4` to `uint32_t` to make it clear that it is a 32-bit unsigned integer.
- Renamed `local_10` to `controlRegValue` to describe the purpose of reading the control register value into this buffer.
- Renamed `auStack_c` to `tempStackBuffer` to suggest that it is a temporary buffer for stack alignment or extra storage, as its exact purpose isn't clear from this snippet.
- Added `#define REG_CONTROL_STATUS 0x24` to give context to the magic number `0x24`, assuming it's a control/status register address based on how it's being used.
- Replaced `FUN_00040314` with `ReadRegister`, as it's presumably a function that reads a value from a register.
- Replaced `FUN_00040390` with `WriteRegister`, as it appears to write a new value to a register.
- Added comments to each line to explain what the code is doing at a high level.
