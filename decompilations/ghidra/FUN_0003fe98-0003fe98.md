```c
#include <string.h> // include the header for memcpy function

// Function that initializes a configuration structure with default data
// Arguments:
//   configPtr - pointer to the configuration structure that needs to be initialized
void InitializeConfiguration(void *configPtr)
{
  // Predefined default configuration data
  extern unsigned char DefaultConfigData[0x124];

  // Check if the configPtr is non-null before proceeding
  if (configPtr == NULL) {
    return; // Exit if the pointer is null to avoid dereferencing null
  }
  
  // Placeholder function that might perform necessary pre-initialization steps
  PreInitializationRoutine();
  
  // Copy the predefined default configuration data into the provided structure
  memcpy(configPtr, DefaultConfigData, 0x124); // 0x124 is the size of the default data
  
  // End of the initialization function
  return;
}
```

Comments:
- Renamed `FUN_0003fe98` to `InitializeConfiguration` which seems to describe what the function is doing: initializing some structure with default data.
- Renamed `FUN_0003fb58` to `PreInitializationRoutine` which seems to indicate a function that should be called before initializing the structure.
- Renamed `param_1` to `configPtr` to reflect that it appears to be a pointer to some configuration structure.
- Added `#include <string.h>` as it is standard practice to include it when using `memcpy`.
- Replaced `DAT_00504b68` with `DefaultConfigData` as a placeholder name for the source of the predefined configuration data. Adding `extern` keyword as it indicates that the actual data is defined elsewhere.
- Added appropriate comments for clarification of the code's intent and functionality.
- Maintained the hexadecimal literal `0x124` to preserve the original data size used in the `memcpy`, which remains the same even if the actual data might be different when the decompiler is used.
- It's worth noting that without the actual default configuration data `DefaultConfigData`, the code might not compile and work as is. This should be defined elsewhere in the real application.
