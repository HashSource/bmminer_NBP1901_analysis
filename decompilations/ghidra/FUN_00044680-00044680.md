```c
// Retrieves the status code from a given miner instance
// Each miner instance has an associated status block of 64 bytes (0x40)
// The status code is a 4-byte value located at an offset of 4 bytes within the block
// `minerStatusArrayBase` is the base address of the status blocks for all miner instances
// `minerIndex` is the index of the target miner instance
// Returns the status code of the specified miner instance as a 4-byte value

uint32_t GetMinerStatusCode(int minerIndex)
{
  // minerStatusArrayBase is assumed to be a global variable that points to the base of the miner status blocks
  extern uint8_t *minerStatusArrayBase;
  
  // Calculate the address of the status code for the desired miner by adding
  // the base address 'minerStatusArrayBase' with the offset for the miner index
  // Each miner's status block is 0x40 bytes apart, and the status code is at offset 4 within the block
  // Return the status code at the calculated address
  return *(uint32_t *)(minerStatusArrayBase + minerIndex * 0x40 + 4);
}
```

Please note that `minerStatusArrayBase` is assumed to be an external global variable that may be defined elsewhere in the code as it is not present within the given code snippet. The type of `minerStatusArrayBase` is assumed to be `uint8_t *` based on the arithmetic performed on it, while the actual type depends on the context in the original code.
