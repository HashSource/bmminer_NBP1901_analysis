```c
void GetSystemInfo(undefined4 *systemInfoBuffer)
{
  // Declare local variables for storing data
  undefined4 chipCount;
  undefined4 chipFrequency;

  // Retrieve the chip count; function probably reads a specific system property (e.g., via I2C/SPI register)
  // Parameter '4' could specify which property to read.
  ReadSystemProperty(4, &chipCount);

  // Retrieve the chip frequency; similar to above, '5' specifies the property for frequency.
  ReadSystemProperty(5, &chipFrequency);

  // Store the retrieved chip count in the first element of the provided buffer
  systemInfoBuffer[0] = chipCount;

  // Store the retrieved chip frequency in the second element of the provided buffer
  systemInfoBuffer[1] = chipFrequency;

  // Return without explicitly returning a value (void function)
  return;
}
```
Please note, the function and variable names such as `GetSystemInfo`, `ReadSystemProperty`, `systemInfoBuffer`, `chipCount`, and `chipFrequency` are inferred based on context and could be different in the actual system. Comments are added to explain the purpose of each step.
