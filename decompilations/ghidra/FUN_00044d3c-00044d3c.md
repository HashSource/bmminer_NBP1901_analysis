```c
uint GetMinerStatus(void)
{
  uint statusBuffer[3]; // Create a buffer to hold status information

  // Retrieve miner hardware status, the function 'FUN_00040314' is assumed to fill 'statusBuffer'
  // with the relevant status data, and '6' indicates the type of information we are requesting
  RetrieveHardwareStatus(6, statusBuffer);
  
  // Return only the relevant part of the status (masking with 0x7fff)
  // assuming this corresponds to the miner's actual working status, excluding other metadata.
  return statusBuffer[0] & 0x7fff;
}
```
