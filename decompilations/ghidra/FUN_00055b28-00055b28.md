```c
void ResetMinerCategoryRules(int minerCategoryPointer)
{
  // Check if the miner category pointer is valid (not NULL)
  if (minerCategoryPointer == 0) {
    LogError(2, "src/category.c", 0xb0, "minerCategoryPointer is null or 0");
    return;
  }
  
  // Check if the fit_rules_backup exists (not NULL)
  if (*(int *)(minerCategoryPointer + 0x44c) != 0) {
    // Call the function to perform a specific reset operation before clearing fit_rules_backup
    PerformResetOperation();
    
    // Clear the fit_rules_backup variable
    *(undefined4 *)(minerCategoryPointer + 0x44c) = 0;
    
    // Also clear another part of the structure, potentially a different set of rules or related data
    memset((void *)(minerCategoryPointer + 0x428), 0, 0x20);
    return;
  }
  
  // Log error if the fit_rules_backup is already NULL (e.g., never updated before)
  LogError(1, "src/category.c", 0xb2, "minerCategoryPointer->fit_rules_backup is NULL, never updated before");
  return;
}
```

**Explanation of Changes Made:**

1. Renamed `FUN_00055b28` to `ResetMinerCategoryRules` to indicate that this function is resetting certain rules or settings for a given miner category.
2. `param_1` has been renamed to `minerCategoryPointer`, implying that it's a pointer to a data structure related to a miner category.
3. `FUN_0005df98` function has been renamed to `LogError` because it appears to log error messages based on its usage and parameters.
4. The magic numbers `0x44c` and `0x428` have been kept as they are likely offsets within a structure pointed to by `minerCategoryPointer`. However, they are candidates for further clarification if the structure layout becomes known.
5. `*(int *)(minerCategoryPointer + 0x44c)` likely represents a pointer to a structure member, possibly named `fit_rules_backup`.
6. `FUN_0005d580()` has been renamed to `PerformResetOperation()` since it's not clear what exactly the function does, but the context suggests some form of reset action related to the backup rules.
7. The error message strings and `memset` operation suggests there is some form of data sanitization or resetting happening on a part of the miner category structure.
8. Added comments to explain what each if-statement and operation likely represents in the context of an embedded system for cryptocurrency mining hardware.
