```c
void SendStatusToController(undefined4 statusCode, uint minerId)
{
  UpdateHardwareStatus(statusCode, 1, 0, 0x14,
               // Reconstruct the minerId from individual bytes using a predefined lookup table
               CONCAT13((MinerIdLookupTable)[minerId >> 0x18],
                        CONCAT12((MinerIdLookupTable)[(minerId << 8) >> 0x18],
                                 CONCAT11((MinerIdLookupTable)[(minerId << 0x10) >> 0x18],
                                          (MinerIdLookupTable)[minerId & 0xff]))));
  return;
}
```
Explanation:
- Renamed `FUN_0005021c` to `SendStatusToController` to better reflect the functionality as it seems to be sending some status information to a controller, possibly for a Bitmain Antminer unit.
- Renamed `param_1` to `statusCode` to imply that it is some form of status code being sent.
- Renamed `param_2` to `minerId`, which might represent an identifier for an individual miner within an array or network of miners.
- Changed the name `FUN_0004fa10` to `UpdateHardwareStatus` assuming this function updates the hardware status.
- Replaced `&DAT_0006a944` with `MinerIdLookupTable` suggesting it is a lookup table used for reconstructing the `minerId`.
- Added a comment above the call to `UpdateHardwareStatus` to explain the process of using a lookup table to reconstruct the `minerId` from individual bytes.

The `CONCAT13`, `CONCAT12`, and `CONCAT11` macros are used to concatenate bytes into a four-byte sequence. The shifting and masking operations on `minerId` are picking out individual bytes and using the lookup table to potentially translate them before concatenating them back together, perhaps for endianness conversion or some kind of encoding based on a look-up-table translation.
