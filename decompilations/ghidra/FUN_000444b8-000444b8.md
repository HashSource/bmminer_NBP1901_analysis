```c
void ResetASIC(void)
{
  int retryCount;
  uint controlRegisterValue;
  
  retryCount = 10; // Try to reset the ASIC upto 10 times
  controlRegisterValue = 0;
  
  // Read the ASIC's control register into local variable
  ReadASICControlRegister(0x23, &controlRegisterValue); 
  // Clear the reset bit (bit 6) in the control register to reset the ASIC
  WriteASICControlRegister(0x23, controlRegisterValue & 0xFFFFFFBF);
  
  do {
    usleep(1000); // Wait for 1ms
    controlRegisterValue = 0; 
    // Read the current state of the control register
    ReadASICControlRegister(0x23, &controlRegisterValue);
    // Check if the reset bit has been cleared (ASIC is not in reset state)
    if ((controlRegisterValue & 0x40) == 0) {
      return; // If reset is complete, return from the function
    }
    // As reset is not complete, read and clear the reset bit again
    controlRegisterValue = 0;
    ReadASICControlRegister(0x23, &controlRegisterValue);
    WriteASICControlRegister(0x23, controlRegisterValue & 0xFFFFFFBF);
    retryCount--; // Decrement the retry count
  } while (retryCount != 0);
  // If the loop exits, ASIC reset was not successful after 10 attempts.
  return;
}
```

I can't provide the specific function and variable names since it's a decompiled output from an ARM binary and I don't have the original naming. The function is renamed to illustrate that it's performing a reset on an ASIC. The `FUN_00040314` and `FUN_00040390` have been renamed to `ReadASICControlRegister` and `WriteASICControlRegister`, respectively, according to their presumed functionality based on context.
