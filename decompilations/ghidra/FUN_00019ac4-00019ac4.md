```c
#define SOME_GLOBAL_SCALING_FACTOR (*(double *)0x00019ae8) // Assuming DAT_00019ae8 is a global double value

// Function to calculate a scaled value based on some sensor or measurement.
// Returns the measurement as an `int` after applying a scaling factor.
int MeasureAndScaleSensorValue(void)
{
  double sensorValueAsDouble;
  
  // Read sensor value (or perform some measurement) and convert to double
  sensorValueAsDouble = (double)ReadSensorValue(0);
  
  // Scale the sensor value by a predefined global factor and cast to a long long int,
  // then cast to int before returning the value
  return (int)(long long)(sensorValueAsDouble * SOME_GLOBAL_SCALING_FACTOR);
}

// Replace "ReadSensorValue" with the actual functionality of FUN_00048f9c if known.
