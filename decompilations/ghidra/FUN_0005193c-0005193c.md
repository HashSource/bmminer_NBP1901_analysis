```c
void configureMinerHardware(undefined4 hashRateMode, undefined4 coreVoltage, uint frequency)
{
  // Configure the miner hardware settings with provided hash rate mode, 
  // core voltage, and frequency settings.
  // The last argument is constructed by combining the frequency with a mask.
  // The mask sets the highest bit to 1 (0x80000000) and shifts the frequency left by 8 positions.
  // This is likely to format the value as expected by the hardware for configuration.
  sendMinerConfiguration(hashRateMode, 0, coreVoltage, 0x3c, (frequency & 0xf) << 8 | 0x80000000);
  return;
}
```
Please note that the function `sendMinerConfiguration` is a renamed version of `FUN_0004fa10` as I don't have its actual definition from the provided context. The new names for the parameters and the function itself were chosen to be more descriptive based on the assumptions about their use.
