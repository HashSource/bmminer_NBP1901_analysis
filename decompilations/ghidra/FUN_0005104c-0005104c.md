```c
void SetAntminerFrequency(undefined4 chipId)
{
  uint frequencyConfig;
  undefined4 frequencyValue;
  
  // Read the current frequency settings
  ReadFrequencySettings(0, chipId, 0, 0x90, &frequencyValue);
  
  // Modify the frequency settings based on some criteria
  frequencyConfig = (CONCAT31((int3)(frequencyValue >> 8), 
                              ~(~(byte)frequencyValue & 0x77)) & 0xfffffffd);
  frequencyValue._0_1_ = (byte)frequencyConfig;
  // Set some bits of the frequency settings while keeping others unchanged
  frequencyValue = CONCAT22((short)(frequencyConfig >> 0x10),
                            CONCAT11(frequencyValue._1_1_, (byte)frequencyValue)) & 0xfffff7ff | 0x8000000;
  
  // Write the updated frequency settings back to the chip
  WriteFrequencySettings(chipId, 1, 0, 0x90, frequencyValue);
  return;

**Renaming and Comments:**
- Renamed the function to `SetAntminerFrequency` to reflect its likely action on the frequency setting of a mining chip.
- Renamed `param_1` to `chipId` to clarify the likely purpose of this parameter.
- Renamed `FUN_00051a20` to `ReadFrequencySettings` to indicate it is probably reading frequency configurations.
- Renamed `FUN_0004fa10` to `WriteFrequencySettings` to indicate it is probably writing frequency configurations.
- Renamed `local_c` to `frequencyValue` and `uVar1` to `frequencyConfig` to make their usage clearer.
- Added comments to various lines to explain the logical flow and purpose behind each operation.
