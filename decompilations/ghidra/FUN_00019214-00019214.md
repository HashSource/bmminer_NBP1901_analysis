**Notes:**
- `param_1` was renamed to `chainIndex` for clarity as it indicates which chain is being targeted with the jump to the application.
- `DAT_0007eb9c` was assumed to be some sort of externally defined global logging level and was renamed to `globalLoggingLevel` for readability.
- `acStack_810` was renamed to `logBuffer` to reflect its usage for logging output.
- `FUN_0002e584` was assumed to perform logging, thus renamed to `LogMessage`.
- `FUN_00046554` was assumed to send a jump command to the PIC microcontroller, thus renamed to `SendPICCommand`.
- `usleep(500000)` suspends execution for 500,000 microseconds, or 0.5 seconds.
- `uVar1` was renamed to `firmwareVersion` as it holds the firmware version after reading it from the PIC.
- `FUN_00046178` was assumed to be responsible for getting the PIC firmware version, thus renamed to `GetPICFirmwareVersion`.
- `0x800` (for buffer size) and `500000` (for sleep duration) were extracted as constants for better clarity and maintainability.
- The value `0` passed to the LogMessage function was left as is due to lack of context but likely indicates some flag or option for the logging behaviour.
- Constants and function names use camel case for readability and consistency with many C/C++ naming conventions.
