```c
#include <sys/prctl.h> // Include the prctl function declaration

// Note: Constants like 'prctl' command values should be defined or documented.
// Assuming 0xf corresponds to PR_SET_NAME based on common Linux documentation.

void MonitorMinerStatusThread(void)
{
  // Set the name of the thread to "chk_status" for identification
  prctl(PR_SET_NAME, "chk_status", 0, 0, 0);
  
  // Infinite loop to continually check the miner's status
  while (true) {
    do {
      // These functions likely perform various checks or updates on the miner's status.
      // The actual purpose should be determined by analyzing their implementation.
      CheckHardwareStatus(); // Renamed FUN_00025db0 to CheckHardwareStatus
      UpdateMinerStatistics(); // Renamed FUN_00026670 to UpdateMinerStatistics

      // Sleep for 1000 milliseconds before next iteration.
      // This is a kind of throttling to prevent spamming checks/updates.
      DelayMilliseconds(1000); // Renamed FUN_000304d4 to DelayMilliseconds
    } while (globalStatusVariable != 0); // Renamed DAT_0007f7e0 to globalStatusVariable
    
    // Call a function that seems to perform some corrective action or reset after a status change.
    HandleStatusChange(400); // Renamed FUN_00013da4 to HandleStatusChange
  }
}
```
Keep in mind that decompiled pseudo C lacks variable types, so additional work would be needed to determine the correct types. Additionally, more context or access to the binary's full decompilation would be necessary to provide more accurate names for the functions and variables. The names given here are speculative based on common conventions and best guesses.
