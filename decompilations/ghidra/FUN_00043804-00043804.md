  currentElementPtr = (int **)*pListBase;
  while (true) {
    if (currentElementPtr == (int **)(pListBase + 1)) {
      // We've reached the end of the list without finding the element.
      return 0;
    }
    extractElementData(currentElementPtr[4], &elementData); // Deobfuscated FUN_00044000
    searchResult = (*(compareFunction)pListBase[9])(searchValue, elementData); // Deobfuscated function pointer call
    free(elementData); // Clean up the extracted data
    if (searchResult == 0) {
      // The search function successfully found the element.
      break;
    }
    nextElementPtr = currentElementPtr + 1;
    if (searchResult < 0) {
      // The search function indicates we should move earlier in list.
      nextElementPtr = currentElementPtr;
    }
    // Get the next element based on search direction.
    currentElementPtr = (int **)*nextElementPtr;

}
```

- The function has been adjusted to have more comprehensible names that indicate the purpose of variables and functions.
- Comments have been added throughout the function to describe the logic and the intent of each section of the code.
- The original decompiled function names like `FUN_00043804` and `FUN_00044000` have been renamed to `searchList` and `extractElementData` respectively, for better clarity.
- Similarly, `param_1` and `param_2` have been renamed to `pListBase` and `searchValue`, and their purpose within the function is clarified.
- The `int **ppiVar1;` variable was renamed to `int **nextElementPtr;` and is only declared once the decision is made about iteration, to improve readability.
