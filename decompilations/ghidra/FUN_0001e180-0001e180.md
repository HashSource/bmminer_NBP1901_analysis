```c
// Function to get the miner status value
// param_1: index of the miner (i.e., 0, 1, 2, ...)

uint32_t GetMinerStatusValue(int minerIndex)
{
  // DAT_0058dff4 is likely a base address for status data, possibly in a shared memory structure or buffer.
  // The status of each miner is stored in a structure with a size of 12 bytes (0xc in hex).
  // We add 4 to the base offset to access a specific status value inside the structure.
  
  return *(uint32_t *)(BaseStatusDataAddress + minerIndex * 12 + 4);
}
```

Note: The symbol `DAT_0058dff4` represents a specific memory location, likely a global or static base address, used within the function. Since it's a constant address and its purpose isn't clear without more context, I've renamed it to `BaseStatusDataAddress` to suggest its use as a base address for miner status data. Depending on the actual usage within the entire codebase, you may want to give it a more appropriate name that reflects its function.
