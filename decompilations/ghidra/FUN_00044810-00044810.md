```c
// Function name and variable names have been updated for clarity.

// SetMiningMode: Sets the mining mode to a specific configuration.
uint32_t SetMiningMode(void)
{
    // InitializeASIC: Sends an initialization signal to the ASIC miner.
    InitializeASIC(0x23);
    // ConfigureASIC: Configures the ASIC miner with a specific frequency.
    ConfigureASIC(0x23, 0x80);
    return 0;
}
// Note: The magic numbers 0x23 and 0x80 should ideally be replaced with descriptive macros or constants 
// to improve code clarity, but without additional context, this cannot be done here.
