// Renaming the function to 'shutdownAntminer' for better readability.
// Renaming the other function to 'sendShutdownSignal' and the magic number 0xf as 'SHUTDOWN_SIGNAL'
// Added comments explaining what each part of the code is doing.

#define SHUTDOWN_SIGNAL 0xf  // Define a constant for the shutdown signal value.

// Function prototype for clarity, assumed to be elsewhere in the code base.
void sendShutdownSignal(int signal);

// shutdownAntminer - Initiates the shutdown process for the Antminer system.
// Returns an undefined4 type, which is typically used in decompiled code to represent int.
// Since this is a very simple function, the original return type is assumed to be int.
int shutdownAntminer(void) {
  // Send a shutdown signal to the Antminer system.
  sendShutdownSignal(SHUTDOWN_SIGNAL);
  
  // Return 0 indicating success.
