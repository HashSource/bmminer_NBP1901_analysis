```c
#include <signal.h>  // Include the signal library for raise()

// This function checks if both provided parameters are zero, and if so, raises
// a divide by zero exception. It also calls another function regardless of the
// check, likely to perform some clean-up or notification logic.

                                    int divisor, int reserved)

  // If both divisor and reserved are 0, raise a divide by zero exception
  if ((divisor == 0) && (reserved == 0)) {
    raise(SIGFPE);  // Raise the floating point exception (divide by zero)
    return;
  }

  // Call another function which could perform cleanup or other housekeeping tasks
  performHousekeeping();
  return;
}

// Placeholder for the actual implementation of the referenced function.
// This is a forward declaration and actual implementation should be elsewhere.
