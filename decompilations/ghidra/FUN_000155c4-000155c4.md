```c
int GetMinimumFanSpeed(void)
{
  short retrievedFanSpeed; // Used to store the fan speed retrieved from the function
  int currentFanIndex;     // Index for looping through fans
  int minimumFanSpeed;     // Final minimum speed detected across all fans
  int tempSpeed;           // Temporarily stores the fan speed for comparison purposes
  int threshSpeed;         // Threshold speed to compare against, starts with max value for short type
  
  currentFanIndex = 0;   // Initialize the index to start with the first fan
  threshSpeed = 0xff;    // Start with a high threshold value for comparison (255)
  
  // Loop through the fans (assuming 4 fans in the system)
  do {
    // Get the speed of the current fan
    retrievedFanSpeed = GetFanSpeed(currentFanIndex, 2);
    tempSpeed = (int)retrievedFanSpeed;
    
    // Initialize minimumFanSpeed to the first valid fan speed value
    minimumFanSpeed = threshSpeed;
    
    // Check if the speed is valid and less than the previously found minimum
    if (((tempSpeed != 0xff) && // Speed must be valid (not 255 which might indicate an error or no fan)
        (minimumFanSpeed = tempSpeed, threshSpeed != 0xff)) && // Assign new value if threshold is not 0xff
        (minimumFanSpeed = threshSpeed, threshSpeed <= tempSpeed)) {  // Update minimum speed if current speed is lower
      minimumFanSpeed = tempSpeed;
    }
    
    // Move on to the next fan
    currentFanIndex = currentFanIndex + 1;

Explanation of changes:
- `FUN_000155c4` has been changed to `GetMinimumFanSpeed` which gives better insight into what the function does.
- `FUN_000153ec` is assumed to be a function that retrieves the fan speed given an index and some other parameter (named `2` here which is not clear and should ideally have a proper name or comment explaining its purpose), so it has been renamed to `GetFanSpeed`.
- Variables have been renamed to more descriptive names that indicate their purpose:
   - `iVar2` to `tempSpeed`
   - `iVar3` to `currentFanIndex`
   - `iVar4` to `threshSpeed`
   - `iVar5` to `minimumFanSpeed`
- Added comments throughout the code to describe the steps and logic.
